<p>With 61 percent of marketers citing their top inbound marketing priority is to improve SEO (search engine optimization) and grow their organic presence according to <a href="http://www.stateofinbound.com/?__hstc=20629287.2307c00a75951ac412f22e5d6a630011.1509885237296.1524474170816.1524663373158.4&amp;__hssc=20629287.1.1524663373158&amp;__hsfp=962579618">HubSpot’s 2017 State of Inbound report</a>, the <a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/anatomy-successful-digital-marketing-campaign/">digital marketing campaigns</a> need to drive engagement by evoking emotions and capturing the imagination of the target audience.

<p>To help you out, here we have aligned five out-of-the-box digital marketing examples from 2018 (thus far), so you cans see what strategies they have used to influence the users.</p>
<h3><strong>1. ABTA Jumps on the ‘#footselfie’ Bandwagon to Lure Holidaymakers</strong></h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-18252 size-full" src="https://static.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/1.png" alt=" digital marketing campaign" width="589" height="410" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/1.png 589w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/1-300x209.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 589px) 100vw, 589px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Image Credit: </strong><a href="http://contentworks.agency/5-tourism-brands-who-get-social-media/?utm_source=BuzzInteractive.co&amp;utm_medium=BuzzBlog&amp;utm_campaign=intuit%20brand%20mentions"><strong>ContentWorks</strong></a></p>
<p>Last year, ABTA, a renowned association of travel agents and tour operations in the United Kingdom, launched a campaign on Boxing Day to highlight why vacationers should book with an ABTA member throughout January.</p>
<p>The campaign was named ‘Travel with Confidence’. The <strong><a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/">digital marketing agency</a></strong> handling the campaign tapped into the social media trend of taking ‘footselfies’ to show the wide array of destinations from ABTA brands. Besides this, they also promoted the hashtag #beABTAsmart and arranged a competition for social media users which gave them the opportunity to win several prizes.</p>
<h3><strong>2.Intuit Creates an Animated Movie to Get its Idea Across </strong></h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-18253 size-full" src="https://static1.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/2.jpg" alt="digital marketing agency " width="720" height="720" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/2.jpg 720w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/2-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/2-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/2-570x570.jpg 570w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/2-500x500.jpg 500w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/2-700x700.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Image Credit: </strong><a href="https://intuitblog.com/?utm_source=BuzzInteractive.co&amp;utm_medium=BuzzBlog&amp;utm_campaign=intuit%20brand%20mentions"><strong>Intuit</strong></a></p>
<p>Intuit — that develops and sells tax preparation, accounting, and financial software to individuals and small businesses — launched a new brand campaign this year. The first part of the campaign comprises a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktafrbsKeZw">short animated story of two business owners</a> that was showcased at the 2018 Super Bowl.</p>
<p>The idea was to bring all of Intuit’s brands together, including <a href="https://quickbooks.intuit.com/?utm_source=BuzzInteractive.co&amp;utm_medium=BuzzBlog&amp;utm_campaign=intuit%20brand%20mentions">Quickbooks</a>, <a href="https://www.mint.com/?utm_source=BuzzInteractive.co&amp;utm_medium=BuzzBlog&amp;utm_campaign=intuit%20brand%20mentions">Mint</a>, and <a href="https://turbotax.intuit.com/?utm_source=BuzzInteractive.co&amp;utm_medium=BuzzBlog&amp;utm_campaign=intuit%20brand%20mentions">TurboTax</a>. Since millions of people were using Intuit’s products, but only four out of every thousand users were leveraging two or more of them. So the brand took the leap of faith and attempted to show the audience that its products are best when used together.</p>
<p>To represent the power of its products, the company’s digital marketing agency created a character of a giant robot in the animated movie. The agency believed animation was the best way to get Intuit’s idea across. The 15-second teaser was run during the Super Bowl LII, driving users back to the full film online.</p>
<p>In addition, the social media campaign of the brand featured a Snapchat filter showcasing the Intuit Giant. The robot was used as a symbol in the campaign showcasing how the brand’s services harness technology to make financial processes easy-peasy for its users. The animated movie revolves around Pete, a flower shop owner, who fails to find time to enjoy his outside passions owing to his frantic schedule and Pari, an engineer and entrepreneur, who is keen to help him by creating the Intuit Giant.</p>
<p>Shedding light on the target audience for the marketing campaign, the chief marketing officer, Lucas Watson divulged there are 750 million people around the globe that work for themselves and manage their finances while chasing their passions. Unfortunately, the pressure of managing time and money sometimes makes them feel as if the odds are stacked against them.</p>
<p>The campaign has worked wonders for the brand so it will continue to use it throughout the year. In fact, Intuit will work on additional channels and executions to promote its cohort of services.</p>
<h3><strong>3. Dollar Shave Club Marks its Arrival in the UK with a Creative Campaign</strong></h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-18254 size-full" src="https://static2.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Dollar-Shave-Club-Marks-its-Arrival-in-the-UK-with-a-Creative-Campaign.jpg" alt="digital marketing examples" width="960" height="600" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Dollar-Shave-Club-Marks-its-Arrival-in-the-UK-with-a-Creative-Campaign.jpg 960w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Dollar-Shave-Club-Marks-its-Arrival-in-the-UK-with-a-Creative-Campaign-300x188.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Dollar-Shave-Club-Marks-its-Arrival-in-the-UK-with-a-Creative-Campaign-768x480.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Dollar-Shave-Club-Marks-its-Arrival-in-the-UK-with-a-Creative-Campaign-700x438.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Image Credit: </strong><a href="http://www.cityam.com/246010/razor-sharp-move-unilever-its-acquisition-dollar-shave-club?utm_source=BuzzInteractive.co&amp;utm_medium=BuzzBlog&amp;utm_campaign=intuit%20brand%20mentions"><strong>CityAm</strong></a></p>
<p>Founded in 2011, Dollar Shave Club was acquired by Unilever in 2016. Lately, the razor subscription brand decided to step into the UK market and to mark its arrival the company used a creative social and experiential campaign.</p>
<p>Not only the Dollar Shave Club launched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wpk_ltU2q3M">a pop-up in Old Street station</a> earlier in January to offer passers-by free shaves, live comedy, and foosball tournaments but also partnered with several social influencers to create hype and relevant content around the launch. This partnership worked for the firm as it made the heads turn.</p>
<p>Sure, we are yet to see if the Dollar Shave Club’s products make a strong impact in the UK market. But, if you compare the hotly anticipated marketing campaign of the brand with the classic US version, you’ll come to know that Dollar Shave Club is surely off to a good start.</p>
<h3><strong>4. ESSC Launches a Thought-Provoking Campaign to Encourage Social Change</strong></h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-18255 size-full" src="https://static.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/4.gif" alt="digital marketing examples" width="656" height="258" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Image Credit: </strong><a href="http://www.easterseals.com/michigan/get-involved/quit-smoking-now.html?utm_source=BuzzInteractive.co&amp;utm_medium=BuzzBlog&amp;utm_campaign=intuit"><strong>ESSC</strong></a></p>
<p>Easterseals Southern California (ESSC) is an organization that assists over 10,000 people with disabilities in different parts of California. The organization has recently launched a new thought-provoking ad campaign that stars its own program recipients. The title of the campaign was “Changing the Way to See Disability,” and its aim was to encourage social change and create inclusion. And to make it work the marketers came up with a really catchy slogan: ‘Celebrate. Don’t Separate.’</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-18256 size-full" src="https://static1.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/5.jpg" alt="digital marketing examples" width="1200" height="600" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/5.jpg 1200w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/5-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/5-768x384.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/5-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/5-1000x500.jpg 1000w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/5-700x350.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Image Credit: </strong><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/celebratedontseparate?utm_source=BuzzInteractive.co&amp;utm_medium=BuzzBlog&amp;utm_campaign=intuit"><strong>#CelebrateDontSeparate</strong></a></p>
<p>According to Mark Whitley, the President, and CEO of ESSC, when people unite as one, they can break down barriers and create social change. He said that each day people make sweeping statements about people with disabilities and a lot of them don’t even realize what they are doing. So to aid people to look beyond what they see at first glance ESSC has launched this movement so we can have a more inclusive world.</p>
<p>The campaign was rolled out through many different channels, including internet, print, and outdoor ads along with “Make the Promise” <a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/social-media-marketing-tips-for-restaurant-business/">social media campaign</a>. The idea behind launching the social media campaign was to ask general people to promote the message of inclusion and use the hashtag #CelebrateDontSeparate.</p>
<p>To create a profound impact, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/EasterSealsSoCal">six California residents were used in the first phase of the campaign</a> along with two ESSC recipients who met through the program and are now engaged. The new campaign has greatly helped ESSC in bringing the social change.</p>
<h3><strong>5. LinkedIn Steps Up to Crush its ‘White Collar’ Typecast with New Campaign</strong></h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-18257 size-full" src="https://static1.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/youtube.jpg" alt="digital marketing Agency" width="1280" height="720" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/youtube.jpg 1280w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/youtube-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/youtube-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/youtube-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/youtube-700x394.jpg 700w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/youtube-539x303.jpg 539w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Image Credit: </strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MsEvg14Y_A&amp;utm_source=BuzzInteractive.co&amp;utm_medium=BuzzBlog&amp;utm_campaign=intuit%20brand%20mentions"><strong>YouTube</strong></a></p>
<p>The popular business social network LinkedIn is looking to squash it&#8217;s ‘white collar’ typecast and to realize its dream the brand has released a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VS4sNlXPsB0">TV spot titled “In it Together”</a> back in January during the 2018 Golden Globe Awards show.</p>
<p>This was something LinkedIn has never done in the past. However, it certainly makes sense since the brand is looking to disentangle itself from its current perception. The influential thing about the “In it Together” campaign was the diverse range of businesses and people that featured in it.</p>
<p>The new campaign was the first real integrated marketing effort by the social network. Apart from the TV spot, the marketing campaign also included a digital display, online video, search engine marketing, paid social media &amp; outdoor ads, partnerships, podcasts, and radio spots. All in all, the campaign lasted for 12 weeks and it targeted four core markets: Los Angeles, San Francisco, Atlanta, and Philadelphia.</p>
<p>The idea was to compare LinkedIn activity in these cities with other parts of the world that haven’t been targeted to comprehend the results of the campaign. The black-and-white, documentary-style video showcased the success stories of LinkedIn users in their own unique environments.</p>
<p>While explaining the impact of the campaign Stacy Peralta, the campaign director, revealed in an email to Adweek that she knew from the beginning that this is one of those rare opportunities. Because LinkedIn wanted her to share real stories about real people and they wanted the candor, energy, and enthusiasm of the people involved.</p>
<p>So her team found and documented unique people who are using the platform. They filmed new musicians, real-life cowboys, chefs, MMA fighters, animators, and physics teachers. All of them were not only using LinkedIn but are keen to share its effect on their careers.</p>
<h3><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, the tried-and-tested elements of advertising remain the same, but the unique thing about all the aforementioned marketing campaigns is the use of elements that produced emotions, encouraged empathy and most of all humanizes the brand. This tells digital marketing service providers to explore various avenues in order to find the best fit for their clients so they can achieve desired results.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Digital marketing is one of the emerging communication mediums of this era of technology and social media. Nowadays, brands use multiple tactics to win the attention by giving away what matters the most to the audience. The arbitrage of attention and value between the customers and brands is what that is redefining the business development and marketing strategies.</p>
<p>A successful digital marketing campaign refers to the fruitful engagement of the prospective customers on the internet. However, the digital marketing doesn’t always provide outcome on the financial side, but sometimes it’s related to brand positioning and recognition.</p>
<p>Every company’s digital marketing campaign is unique, not to mention their methods are always different. In some cases, it is quite possible that the agency that is designing the whole campaign drives the whole strategy. On the other hand, some brands prefer to define their <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/digital-marketing-tactics-win-brand-war-muhammad-gohar-shafique/">digital marketing strategy</a> based on the consensus between the brand and agency.</p>
<p>Pay close attention if you’re a brand and haven’t had a chance to run a digital marketing campaign either through any <a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/"><strong>digital marketing agency</strong></a> or in-house staff.</p>
<p>Following are the basics of running a successful digital marketing campaign:</p>
<h3>1- Understanding the Brand Identity</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-17069 size-full" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/brand-identity.jpg" alt="brand identity" width="1266" height="500" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/brand-identity.jpg 1266w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/brand-identity-300x118.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/brand-identity-768x303.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/brand-identity-1024x404.jpg 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/brand-identity-700x276.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1266px) 100vw, 1266px" /></p>
<p>It’s true that digital marketing revolves around various forms of communication such as content creation, online advertising, and social media, but to start off on the right foot, a brand must figure out its identity. If a brand doesn’t know about its value proposition, target audience, competitive edge, and competition, then it won’t be able to make an impact. So understanding the brand identity means getting to know the brand inside out. If the team behind a brand knows these elements, they can certainly pull this off the right way. It’s easy to decide whether you should run ads on Facebook or Google or Twitter, but understanding the brand’s identity is somewhat that comes before hopping onto any advertising platform. A successful digital marketing campaign is built on acknowledging the message that the brand has to convey what differentiates them from the competition.</p>
<h3>2- Delivering the Value</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-17070 size-full" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/digital-graph.jpg" alt="value graph" width="1266" height="500" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/digital-graph.jpg 1266w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/digital-graph-300x118.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/digital-graph-768x303.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/digital-graph-1024x404.jpg 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/digital-graph-700x276.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1266px) 100vw, 1266px" /></p>
<p>Digital marketing is a multi-dimensional strategy, and every individual brand chooses a specific area to go all in. Without embracing the brand identity and without being aware of the strengths, it becomes difficult for a brand to put something out for the audience to consume. However, delivering the value is one of the most important aspects of digital marketing. A campaign, for example, a Facebook video ad may not get traction if it doesn’t stand out or not reaching to the right audience. A brand must find out what kind of content such as written, audio, video, or graphical resonates with its audience because that’s the way forward to providing the right type of information the audience is expecting to get. It won’t be unfair to say that any valuable piece of content that provides the value upfront has a better chance to perform well than the clickable banner ad that could lead to somewhere else. Provide value upfront and build your brand’s momentum on top of that rather than being salesy and directly selling the product through online advertising. Have you seen some YouTube pre-roll ads that have a useful message to share and perhaps we watch the ad? So the successful digital marketing campaign must be delivering the value without asking for asking anything in return, at least, for the time being.</p>
<h3>3- Igniting the Engagement</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-17071 size-full" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/engagement-measurement.jpg" alt="engagement measurement" width="1266" height="500" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/engagement-measurement.jpg 1266w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/engagement-measurement-300x118.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/engagement-measurement-768x303.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/engagement-measurement-1024x404.jpg 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/engagement-measurement-700x276.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1266px) 100vw, 1266px" /></p>
<p>A digital marketing campaign can’t be considered a success unless it entices people to respond mostly in a positive manner. People react to the extremely positive, negative, or helpful things they see on the internet. Most of the brands like to touch the helpful or positive section of the chart. So if a campaign whether it’s an ad, article, infographic, video, or an audio creates a buzz around and arouses people to react to it, then it’s serving its purpose.</p>
<h3>4- Solving a Problem</h3>

<p>Whether you’re doing video marketing, content marketing, infographics, visuals, or podcasting, you can create a robust digital marketing campaign around any medium of content creation you choose. The only thing that matters is becoming the part of the solution. If your talks or written words or images solve any problem of the right audience, you’re all good. A highly cinematic video ad may get attention in the beginning, but if the message is unclear, then the brand won’t reap the benefits later. The reason for this is that the majority of people might get confused with the message or interpret it wrong. So ambiguity leads to low response rate. On the flip side, if the message is clear and resonates with the audience, it could lead to virality. Therefore, to make it  successful, one must clarify the message to ensure that it solves the problem.</p>
<h3>5- Analyzing the Outcome</h3>

<p>One of the perks of a successful digital marketing campaign is that you get to see things that worked well for your brand’s marketing. If you’re emphasizing a lot on written content and the certain type of articles are performing better than the others, then you can create relevant content so that it doubles down the impact. There are no specific tools to analyze the outcome. However, a lot of SEO results could be seen through Ahrefs, SEMrush, and Majestic tools. It comes down to every individual brand’s choice. Maybe, a brand is looking at its Google Analytics to gather the traffic data, and the other brand is keen to collect the email subscribers’ data through email marketing software like MailChimp or Aweber, whereas maybe another brand is following the Facebook ad statistics to hone the ad strategy. The critical part is the analysis of the outcome, which may lead to improving the whole campaign.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>A digital marketing campaign comprises of various components. Every brand chooses to focus on the specific type of content to produce, publish, and promote. Once they put it out there, they need to leverage the content by taking it in front of the right kind of eyeballs. To make that happen, either they choose online advertising or search engine optimization or content marketing to win the attention of the prospective clients.</p>
<p>A successful digital marketing campaign, however, doesn’t guarantee the financial transaction, but it instead builds a relationship between the brand and the audience.</p>
