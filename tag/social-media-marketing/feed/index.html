								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Social Media is one of the largest platform and the quickest form for businesses if they want to get digitally active and get exposure of their service or product by a large number of people.</p>
<p>No one ever thought that social media networking sites would ever benefit businesses as it was merely seen as a medium for youngsters to get in contact with their friends and family. Soon the networking sites were revamped and were seen being thronged by many businesses either online or not and getting their customer base and brand identity to a whole new level.</p>
<p>Many businesses have integrated <strong><a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/social-media-services/">social media marketing</a></strong> in their marketing strategy and seen a drastic change in their customer base, brand awareness, recognition, and image, however for small businesses these sites turn into a mega triumph as compared to large businesses which we will talk about in the later stage. According to research, 75% of small businesses have been seen using social media as a marketing tool and it proved to be a really good strategy.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>How is Social Media Advantageous for Small Businesses in Marketing?</strong></h2>
<p>Old times have gone when small businesses used to find it difficult in bringing themselves up on the radar and due to their confined budgets, huge advertisements were not possible, which means low market share and growth along with a small customer base.</p>
<p>Large businesses would really take up a great amount of market share and would make it difficult for small businesses to step out of their niche.</p>
<p>Let’s talk about how <a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/social-media-marketing-tips-for-restaurant-business/">Social media can benefit a small business</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>1. Small Businesses are Closely Connected with Their Customers</strong></h3>
<p>Don’t take it wrong, large businesses do put their customers as the number one priority but small business’s structure is also small which means they don’t have to deal with large management issues so they can provide a great deal of attention to their customers.</p>
<p>A small business will have all the time available to deal with its customers’ concerns much more quickly and with much more effort. Many small-scale businesses really need to improve their image and create a strong customer base, therefore, keeping their customers satisfied is given immense importance.</p>
<p>How can such an attitude <strong><a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/7-effective-social-media-marketing-tips-enhance-online-business/">help small businesses in social media marketing</a></strong>? Small businesses are much more efficient in providing good customer service on social media; they have enough time to deal with their customers’ concerns in details and reply to their comments, reviews, or messages.</p>
<p>Customers really appreciate when a business creates a community-centric environment where customers feel an important part of the whole business and so this creates a strong customer relationship, therefore, the brand loyalty and image is improved which consequently increases business sales and customer base.</p>
<h3><strong>2. Advertising is Cost Effective</strong></h3>
<p>Social media has made it easy for small businesses to reach a large number of customers by investing less in the promotion of their brand which goes quite well with the budget available.</p>
<p>Small scale businesses through the use of cost-effective promotional services provided by social networking sites like Facebook are highly engaging, it reaches a large number of audience.</p>
<p>It is quite expensive to advertise and aware customers about any product development, discounts and much more through any other medium of marketing. Facebook advertisements have a geo-targeting feature which means that advertisements can be done in the current location of the business, therefore, investing in such ads is cheap, effective and will not exceed the budget.</p>
<p>Due to the reason that such small businesses know their customers from really close, they can set up promotional campaigns that are according to their specific needs and provide content that can be relatable to the customers.</p>
<p>Such promotional campaigns may boost the business-customer relationship along with making the brand well recognized within their market that may help them achieve a better competitive ground.</p>
<p>Not only that, this marketing is an effective way of attracting not only the current customers but also new ones with a low budget.</p>
<h3><strong>3. Small Businesses are More Personalized </strong></h3>
<p>Small business knows its customers as it gives emphasis to the customers much more than a large business therefore as a small business owner would know their customers’ thoughts and desires making it more personalized which will help in implementing a great marketing strategy. This will generate such a brand name and image that will be carved in the hearts of your customers.</p>
<p>When using social media marketing these attributes of a small company such as being market-oriented and developing a product that is in compliance with customer requirements can get you in the footprint of social media and allow you to gather and engage with a much wider market.</p>
<p>A small business will also be readily available to shout-out to its customers and exchange a few words with them through messages and comments which will generate an image about the brand that it really cares about its customers.</p>
<p>When we talk about large businesses, they are highly concentrated on their product development, management system and most importantly revenue, so giving personalized service is what they slack.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>People use their mobile devices for more than 100 times a day and they are seen using social media sites the most due to which <a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/">Digital Marketing Agencies</a> are using <a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/5-ways-to-boost-ecommerce-business-through-social-media/">social media marketing strategy</a> in the marketing mix of businesses.</p>
<p>The fastest way seen to promote your brand is through social media sites so let’s talk about it.</p>
<h3><strong>1. Facebook Marketing</strong></h3>
<p>This one is the largest platform among the social media sites, where millions of people daily check-in to connect with people, to search for brands; attain their information etc.</p>
<p>It is thus an important platform for brand promotion and awareness but how can a restaurant business make full use of this networking site efficiently and effectively.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Creating a Fan Page</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The first and foremost part is to create a page which will help your restaurant business to put all the details regarding your brand; there are different tabs like, Home, About, Posts, Videos etc.</p>
<p>The about section includes all the details about your brand, such that website link, contact info, location, and others and it is an important area which will help the customers get an idea about the business and possibly allow to have a contact with you.</p>
<p>Now that you have established a Facebook fan page, raise awareness and engagement.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Professional Designed Posts</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In order to engage with your audience, you need to post high-quality pictures containing aesthetic sense which will lure the customers to your eatery; use images of your mouthwatering meals.</p>
<p>Especially for food businesses such as restaurants, marketing on social media through an array of cuisine images is a must.</p>
<p>In general, the posts should include your product’s images because customers need to learn about your product; new deals, any new product developed etc. Therefore, a restaurant business can include a variety of their cuisines, any new addition in any one of their cuisine, also you can create a look book of the entire menu with prices and full detail about the ingredients used.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use Videos as a Marketing Tool</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Nowadays videos are becoming immensely important as a part of marketing on social media, they go viral within seconds, and therefore it would turn out to be a good source of brand promotion and awareness.</p>
<p>Uploading videos maybe of how your food is made, or maybe have short interviews with your staff so that people learn about your team and feel like a part of your brand. You may also make videos on social service; helping others, giving free food to homeless and poor, which will create an emotional attachment for you with your clients.</p>
<p>This would work as a PR booster also allow more and more people to connect with your brand, boost the engagement rate and establish a brand image.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Promotional Campaigns</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Establish a high level of user participation and brand awareness by using campaigns such as contests, discounts, redeemable codes, etc. This will not only attract and boost engagement from current customers, but it can also convert users into potential customers and lead them to your restaurant.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Boost Your Posts</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Organically reaching a large number of people on Facebook is time-consuming and slow way, but you can spend small amounts of money to reach a large number of target audience.</p>
<p>Facebook also allows to geo-target your ads as you can control which location the ads should be seen, ads can target your type of niche and can grab the attention of people you target specifically.</p>
<h3><strong>2. Instagram Marketing</strong></h3>
<p>Instagram is a large platform for photo sharing and it stimulates visual posts only, therefore it can be a good source to have your restaurant business promoted.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Instagram works best with hashtags and can improve your brand’s awareness quickly.</p>
<p>Use the following methods to get your brand promoted and lure people to your establishment</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Share Your Menu </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You can make a post including your menu item to let people know about different types of meals available. The menu is important for a restaurant business because mostly that is the one thing people look for on social media sites.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Add High-Quality Images</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Take full advantage of this platform to promote your brand through images. Add high-quality images of a wide variety of your meals/cuisines.</p>
<p>You may also engage people and attract them to your restaurant by adding images of your restaurant to let them know about the environment it provides.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hashtag Usage</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Use hashtags for your specific niche to reach food lovers, this will increase your following and engagement of your posts. Furthermore, it will boost your restaurant’s awareness too.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Staff Appraisal and Videos</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Appraise your staff and increase customers’ engagement by adding staff videos and letting know people about their performance. This will encourage people to link themselves with the brand and generate an image in their minds that it is a fun place to hang in, while on the other hand the employees will feel enriched and boost the restaurant’s environment even more.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Brand Promotion</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You can also promote your posts and target to specific audience related to your niche, this will help to boost your following and improve the customer base.</p>
<h3><strong>3. Pinterest Marketing</strong></h3>
<p>Pinterest is another social media platform which helps to boost a large catalog of ideas where you can create boards on your home page.</p>
<p>The best and most relevant board for a restaurant business can be</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Recipe Board:</strong> Publish recipes of your different kinds of meals and let people know how to make mouthwatering meals at home.</li>
<li><strong>Menu Item Board: </strong>Publish menus of different cuisines and if possible add their price and ingredient details.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can set up many different boards and establish a following of customers. Research has shown that Pinterest is used mostly by women’s, therefore, the promotion of the restaurant business through this site can be beneficial.</p>
<p>Moreover, Pinterest also allows paid advertising, which will help generate a following and customer base quickly and promote your pins to a large number of people.</p>
<h3><strong>4. Twitter Marketing</strong></h3>
<p>A trendy social media site for restaurant businesses, whether small or big where power is of hashtags, just like Instagram.</p>
<p>You have 140 words at every update so the most successful way to get your brand promoted is by using links and images.</p>
<p>The real games isn’t about images on Twitter, therefore add links to your menu with using catchy lines that actually enables the users to click them, and links to your other social networking pages can be used to direct the audience to that site and allow them to learn more about your brand.</p>
<p>If you really want to have your brand to catch users’ attention you must time your tweets at different times such as at breakfast time if you have a breakfast deal, dinner time etc. Moreover, paid promotion is also a way to spread the words to a large number of people.</p>
<h3><strong>5. Foursquare Check-Ins</strong></h3>
<p>Foursquare is a social networking site where you can find the best places to eat, drink and shop around in your particular location. People use check-ins of places they go and leave reviews.</p>
<p>Register your business on this platform; see how many people are checking-in and how the reviews can help you understand what the people need improvements in. It can work as a way to add to people’s knowledge about your restaurant.</p>
<p>As we conclude Social Media is one of the largest platforms for almost anything now; it has made it easy to connect to millions of people at once. Not only social media has grown to its peak but mobile phones have also been growing in its usage level, which has given an immense boost to mobile apps and social sites, therefore, <strong><a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/social-media-services/">Social Media Marketing Services</a></strong> has become immensely important for almost all businesses.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s astonishing to see how marketing is changing rapidly. The shift from TV commercials and billboards to Snapchat Ads and Facebook Ads is fascinating to see. What the question arises is that how long it would last. What we need to do in this very moment of time is that we should start paying attention to what the people from 13 to 55 are looking at and what tools they&#8217;re using to socialize when they&#8217;re holding their smartphones.</p>
<p>In the pre-social media world, meaning, before 2003, things were quite different, let alone the online marketing wasn&#8217;t impacting at scale. Then comes the social media; Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter were born. The global connectivity went to a new height. Besides that, the attention arbitrage started to change, meaning, calling cards, internet cards, SMS, MSN Messenger, Yahoo Messenger, and ICQ got replaced by the WhatsApp, WeChat, Viber, Skype, and Facetime. We all have seen and lived through that transition.</p>
<p>Then, another attention arbitrage change happened in the recent time when TV commercials, cable TV, DVD/BlueRay got replaced by Netflix, iflix, Hulu, YouTube, and Facebook.</p>
<p>So new age marketing refers to the ever-changing attention phenomenon that we need to understand in today&#8217;s mobile-internet world, where people are using the 4G internet and the internet is being used on mobile devices more than the desktop computers.</p>
<p>Before going into the rabbit hole of using the power of content that brands need to understand; we should look at the types of content that brands and entrepreneurs can utilize to engage, attract, and convert the audience into customers:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-17118 size-full" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/inbound-marketing.jpg" alt="inbound marketing" width="1266" height="500" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/inbound-marketing.jpg 1266w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/inbound-marketing-300x118.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/inbound-marketing-768x303.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/inbound-marketing-1024x404.jpg 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/inbound-marketing-700x276.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1266px) 100vw, 1266px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong> Written content</strong>: It&#8217;s the text-form content such as website content, blog posts, white papers, and ebooks. Any online platform that engages the audience through text content comes in the written content ecosystem.</li>
<li><strong> Video content</strong>: One of the emerging forms of the online content is the video. Brands utilize videos on various platforms like YouTube, Vimeo, Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram, and Twitter to deliver the message across.</li>
<li><strong> Visual content</strong>: It&#8217;s a graphical and illustrative content that is used to engage and educate the prospective audience. For example, infographics, photos, and illustration are the obvious choices in this regard.</li>
<li><strong> Audio content</strong>: The fourth and rapidly growing form of content is the audio. Podcasting is one of the famous examples of the audio content. It&#8217;s an on-demand radio that you can listen to on your smartphone or computer.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These are the fundamental tools of content marketing that play a huge role in the <a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/social-media-services/"><strong>social media marketing </strong></a>campaign &#8211; either you can choose a single one or go with testing out more than one. Either way, it&#8217;s imperative to understand the power of content.</p>
<p>Here is the step-by-step process of using the power of content</p>
<h3><strong>1 &#8211; Discover Your Market Segment</strong></h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-17119 size-full" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/market-segments.jpg" alt="market segments" width="1266" height="500" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/market-segments.jpg 1266w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/market-segments-300x118.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/market-segments-768x303.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/market-segments-1024x404.jpg 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/market-segments-700x276.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1266px) 100vw, 1266px" /></p>
<p>The first and the foremost step you should take in the modern-day marketing is identifying the target audience. It becomes the key to everything you should be doing in your marketing. If you follow the wrong trail all along, you&#8217;ll waste time.</p>
<p>Discovering the marketing segment means:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who you want to reach out</li>
<li>What the audience age group is</li>
<li>Where they belong to (income and status-wise)</li>
<li>What their likes and dislikes are</li>
<li>What social media platforms they use</li>
<li>What they consume online</li>
<li>Where they hang out</li>
<li>What sports they follow</li>
<li>What celebs they look up to</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Such demographic data will give you an insight into prospective audience characteristics. It&#8217;s true that it would require predictions and emotional intelligence to tap into the right kind of people that might be interested in your product or service.</p>
<p>The key benefit of developing the valuable content is that it hits the target audience and solves the problem. The authenticity, however, is determined by the impact it creates in the form of engagement and social sharing. Either you outsource from a <a href="http://www.buzzinteractive.co/"><strong>digital marketing agency</strong></a> or hire a social media marketing expert &#8211; it doesn&#8217;t matter. The narrative should be in-line with your brand&#8217;s vision.</p>
<h3><strong>2 &#8211; </strong><strong>Choose the Right Content Type</strong></h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-17120 size-full" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/content-writing.jpg" alt="content writing" width="1266" height="500" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/content-writing.jpg 1266w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/content-writing-300x118.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/content-writing-768x303.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/content-writing-1024x404.jpg 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/content-writing-700x276.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1266px) 100vw, 1266px" /></p>
<p>The power of content could go off the grid if you&#8217;re serving the wrong type of content to the audience. They won&#8217;t respond or even notice your content, no matter how great and useful the content is. For example, if you&#8217;re a SAAS company and you&#8217;re entirely focusing on written tutorials rather than having a mix of video and written content, then you&#8217;re making a mistake because people might want to see how your online software works. They&#8217;d rather watch a &#8220;how to get started&#8221; video than reading the in-depth blog post about it.</p>
<p>The power of content doesn&#8217;t mean you can pick up any content format and start pumping out content without a plan.</p>
<p>Let’s take the example of <a href="https://www.hubspot.com/">Hubspot</a>. They focus on written content a lot, but they also have video and visuals in their marketing strategy.</p>
<p>Another example is <a href="https://www.smartpassiveincome.com/">Pat Flynn</a> who started off with a blog, then diversified the business. He got into podcasting, and now the podcast is his main focus.</p>
<h3><strong>3 &#8211; Deliver Unconditional Value</strong></h3>
<p>One of the reasons people would stick to your content is that you&#8217;ll be sharing information that matters to them. It&#8217;s the most underrated success hacks out there &#8212; because everybody is going after the best selling techniques and running ads. Whereas, what they should do is sit down for a while and think what they could tell the audience that benefit them and they would come running for more.</p>
<p>Once you develop a habit of giving to others, not only will they pay attention to you, but they would also tell their friends to check you out.</p>
<p><em>Gary Vaynerchuk</em>&#8216;s book &#8220;<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17383989-jab-jab-jab-right-hook">Jab, Jab, Jab, Right Hook</a>&#8221; helps social media marketers understand the importance of building a relationship over adopting sales strategies to get the transaction. This book is a great piece of advice for everyone who wants to crush social media game by putting compelling content out there because it will teach you that besides content, how you can build relationships with customers and knock out the competition.</p>
<p>Another book is &#8220;<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16158498-give-and-take">Give and Take</a>&#8221; by <em>Adam Grant</em>. The genre of this book is business development. The author talked about the value of giving and how givers outsmart the takers and matchers.</p>
