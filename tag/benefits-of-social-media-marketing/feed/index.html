								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Social Media is one of the largest platform and the quickest form for businesses if they want to get digitally active and get exposure of their service or product by a large number of people.</p>
<p>No one ever thought that social media networking sites would ever benefit businesses as it was merely seen as a medium for youngsters to get in contact with their friends and family. Soon the networking sites were revamped and were seen being thronged by many businesses either online or not and getting their customer base and brand identity to a whole new level.</p>
<p>Many businesses have integrated <strong><a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/social-media-services/">social media marketing</a></strong> in their marketing strategy and seen a drastic change in their customer base, brand awareness, recognition, and image, however for small businesses these sites turn into a mega triumph as compared to large businesses which we will talk about in the later stage. According to research, 75% of small businesses have been seen using social media as a marketing tool and it proved to be a really good strategy.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>How is Social Media Advantageous for Small Businesses in Marketing?</strong></h2>
<p>Old times have gone when small businesses used to find it difficult in bringing themselves up on the radar and due to their confined budgets, huge advertisements were not possible, which means low market share and growth along with a small customer base.</p>
<p>Large businesses would really take up a great amount of market share and would make it difficult for small businesses to step out of their niche.</p>
<p>Let’s talk about how <a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/social-media-marketing-tips-for-restaurant-business/">Social media can benefit a small business</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>1. Small Businesses are Closely Connected with Their Customers</strong></h3>
<p>Don’t take it wrong, large businesses do put their customers as the number one priority but small business’s structure is also small which means they don’t have to deal with large management issues so they can provide a great deal of attention to their customers.</p>
<p>A small business will have all the time available to deal with its customers’ concerns much more quickly and with much more effort. Many small-scale businesses really need to improve their image and create a strong customer base, therefore, keeping their customers satisfied is given immense importance.</p>
<p>How can such an attitude <strong><a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/7-effective-social-media-marketing-tips-enhance-online-business/">help small businesses in social media marketing</a></strong>? Small businesses are much more efficient in providing good customer service on social media; they have enough time to deal with their customers’ concerns in details and reply to their comments, reviews, or messages.</p>
<p>Customers really appreciate when a business creates a community-centric environment where customers feel an important part of the whole business and so this creates a strong customer relationship, therefore, the brand loyalty and image is improved which consequently increases business sales and customer base.</p>
<h3><strong>2. Advertising is Cost Effective</strong></h3>
<p>Social media has made it easy for small businesses to reach a large number of customers by investing less in the promotion of their brand which goes quite well with the budget available.</p>
<p>Small scale businesses through the use of cost-effective promotional services provided by social networking sites like Facebook are highly engaging, it reaches a large number of audience.</p>
<p>It is quite expensive to advertise and aware customers about any product development, discounts and much more through any other medium of marketing. Facebook advertisements have a geo-targeting feature which means that advertisements can be done in the current location of the business, therefore, investing in such ads is cheap, effective and will not exceed the budget.</p>
<p>Due to the reason that such small businesses know their customers from really close, they can set up promotional campaigns that are according to their specific needs and provide content that can be relatable to the customers.</p>
<p>Such promotional campaigns may boost the business-customer relationship along with making the brand well recognized within their market that may help them achieve a better competitive ground.</p>
<p>Not only that, this marketing is an effective way of attracting not only the current customers but also new ones with a low budget.</p>
<h3><strong>3. Small Businesses are More Personalized </strong></h3>
<p>Small business knows its customers as it gives emphasis to the customers much more than a large business therefore as a small business owner would know their customers’ thoughts and desires making it more personalized which will help in implementing a great marketing strategy. This will generate such a brand name and image that will be carved in the hearts of your customers.</p>
<p>When using social media marketing these attributes of a small company such as being market-oriented and developing a product that is in compliance with customer requirements can get you in the footprint of social media and allow you to gather and engage with a much wider market.</p>
<p>A small business will also be readily available to shout-out to its customers and exchange a few words with them through messages and comments which will generate an image about the brand that it really cares about its customers.</p>
<p>When we talk about large businesses, they are highly concentrated on their product development, management system and most importantly revenue, so giving personalized service is what they slack.</p>
