								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s astonishing to see how marketing is changing rapidly. The shift from TV commercials and billboards to Snapchat Ads and Facebook Ads is fascinating to see. What the question arises is that how long it would last. What we need to do in this very moment of time is that we should start paying attention to what the people from 13 to 55 are looking at and what tools they&#8217;re using to socialize when they&#8217;re holding their smartphones.</p>
<p>In the pre-social media world, meaning, before 2003, things were quite different, let alone the online marketing wasn&#8217;t impacting at scale. Then comes the social media; Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter were born. The global connectivity went to a new height. Besides that, the attention arbitrage started to change, meaning, calling cards, internet cards, SMS, MSN Messenger, Yahoo Messenger, and ICQ got replaced by the WhatsApp, WeChat, Viber, Skype, and Facetime. We all have seen and lived through that transition.</p>
<p>Then, another attention arbitrage change happened in the recent time when TV commercials, cable TV, DVD/BlueRay got replaced by Netflix, iflix, Hulu, YouTube, and Facebook.</p>
<p>So new age marketing refers to the ever-changing attention phenomenon that we need to understand in today&#8217;s mobile-internet world, where people are using the 4G internet and the internet is being used on mobile devices more than the desktop computers.</p>
<p>Before going into the rabbit hole of using the power of content that brands need to understand; we should look at the types of content that brands and entrepreneurs can utilize to engage, attract, and convert the audience into customers:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-17118 size-full" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/inbound-marketing.jpg" alt="inbound marketing" width="1266" height="500" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/inbound-marketing.jpg 1266w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/inbound-marketing-300x118.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/inbound-marketing-768x303.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/inbound-marketing-1024x404.jpg 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/inbound-marketing-700x276.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1266px) 100vw, 1266px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong> Written content</strong>: It&#8217;s the text-form content such as website content, blog posts, white papers, and ebooks. Any online platform that engages the audience through text content comes in the written content ecosystem.</li>
<li><strong> Video content</strong>: One of the emerging forms of the online content is the video. Brands utilize videos on various platforms like YouTube, Vimeo, Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram, and Twitter to deliver the message across.</li>
<li><strong> Visual content</strong>: It&#8217;s a graphical and illustrative content that is used to engage and educate the prospective audience. For example, infographics, photos, and illustration are the obvious choices in this regard.</li>
<li><strong> Audio content</strong>: The fourth and rapidly growing form of content is the audio. Podcasting is one of the famous examples of the audio content. It&#8217;s an on-demand radio that you can listen to on your smartphone or computer.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These are the fundamental tools of content marketing that play a huge role in the <a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/social-media-services/"><strong>social media marketing </strong></a>campaign &#8211; either you can choose a single one or go with testing out more than one. Either way, it&#8217;s imperative to understand the power of content.</p>
<p>Here is the step-by-step process of using the power of content</p>
<h3><strong>1 &#8211; Discover Your Market Segment</strong></h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-17119 size-full" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/market-segments.jpg" alt="market segments" width="1266" height="500" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/market-segments.jpg 1266w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/market-segments-300x118.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/market-segments-768x303.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/market-segments-1024x404.jpg 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/market-segments-700x276.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1266px) 100vw, 1266px" /></p>
<p>The first and the foremost step you should take in the modern-day marketing is identifying the target audience. It becomes the key to everything you should be doing in your marketing. If you follow the wrong trail all along, you&#8217;ll waste time.</p>
<p>Discovering the marketing segment means:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who you want to reach out</li>
<li>What the audience age group is</li>
<li>Where they belong to (income and status-wise)</li>
<li>What their likes and dislikes are</li>
<li>What social media platforms they use</li>
<li>What they consume online</li>
<li>Where they hang out</li>
<li>What sports they follow</li>
<li>What celebs they look up to</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Such demographic data will give you an insight into prospective audience characteristics. It&#8217;s true that it would require predictions and emotional intelligence to tap into the right kind of people that might be interested in your product or service.</p>
<p>The key benefit of developing the valuable content is that it hits the target audience and solves the problem. The authenticity, however, is determined by the impact it creates in the form of engagement and social sharing. Either you outsource from a <a href="http://www.buzzinteractive.co/"><strong>digital marketing agency</strong></a> or hire a social media marketing expert &#8211; it doesn&#8217;t matter. The narrative should be in-line with your brand&#8217;s vision.</p>
<h3><strong>2 &#8211; </strong><strong>Choose the Right Content Type</strong></h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-17120 size-full" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/content-writing.jpg" alt="content writing" width="1266" height="500" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/content-writing.jpg 1266w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/content-writing-300x118.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/content-writing-768x303.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/content-writing-1024x404.jpg 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/content-writing-700x276.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1266px) 100vw, 1266px" /></p>
<p>The power of content could go off the grid if you&#8217;re serving the wrong type of content to the audience. They won&#8217;t respond or even notice your content, no matter how great and useful the content is. For example, if you&#8217;re a SAAS company and you&#8217;re entirely focusing on written tutorials rather than having a mix of video and written content, then you&#8217;re making a mistake because people might want to see how your online software works. They&#8217;d rather watch a &#8220;how to get started&#8221; video than reading the in-depth blog post about it.</p>
<p>The power of content doesn&#8217;t mean you can pick up any content format and start pumping out content without a plan.</p>
<p>Let’s take the example of <a href="https://www.hubspot.com/">Hubspot</a>. They focus on written content a lot, but they also have video and visuals in their marketing strategy.</p>
<p>Another example is <a href="https://www.smartpassiveincome.com/">Pat Flynn</a> who started off with a blog, then diversified the business. He got into podcasting, and now the podcast is his main focus.</p>
<h3><strong>3 &#8211; Deliver Unconditional Value</strong></h3>
<p>One of the reasons people would stick to your content is that you&#8217;ll be sharing information that matters to them. It&#8217;s the most underrated success hacks out there &#8212; because everybody is going after the best selling techniques and running ads. Whereas, what they should do is sit down for a while and think what they could tell the audience that benefit them and they would come running for more.</p>
<p>Once you develop a habit of giving to others, not only will they pay attention to you, but they would also tell their friends to check you out.</p>
<p><em>Gary Vaynerchuk</em>&#8216;s book &#8220;<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17383989-jab-jab-jab-right-hook">Jab, Jab, Jab, Right Hook</a>&#8221; helps social media marketers understand the importance of building a relationship over adopting sales strategies to get the transaction. This book is a great piece of advice for everyone who wants to crush social media game by putting compelling content out there because it will teach you that besides content, how you can build relationships with customers and knock out the competition.</p>
<p>Another book is &#8220;<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16158498-give-and-take">Give and Take</a>&#8221; by <em>Adam Grant</em>. The genre of this book is business development. The author talked about the value of giving and how givers outsmart the takers and matchers.</p>
<p><em>Brandon Hood</em> rightly <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpN_Vk9CfYM">said</a>, &#8220;Impact is the only thing that will bring the numbers in.&#8221;</p>
<h3><strong>4 &#8211; Test and Analyze</strong></h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-17121 size-full" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/analyzing-marketing-trends.jpg" alt="analyzing marketing trends" width="1266" height="500" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/analyzing-marketing-trends.jpg 1266w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/analyzing-marketing-trends-300x118.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/analyzing-marketing-trends-768x303.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/analyzing-marketing-trends-1024x404.jpg 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/analyzing-marketing-trends-700x276.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1266px) 100vw, 1266px" /></p>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve got a strategy in place, don&#8217;t romanticize with the plan, just test it out and feel free to tweak it, if required. Many entrepreneurs and social media managers design a campaign and they keep their fingers crossed and hope that it would work. A bunch of strategies work and dozens of strategies fail as well.</p>
<p>For instance, if you started focusing on certain keywords in your content, it won&#8217;t guarantee that your blog posts will start to rank immediately. In fact, your specific blog post that you&#8217;re dying to rank on the first page may not rank, and a randomly posted blog post may get better ranking. However, there are techniques that SEOs apply such as site authority, backlinks, and <a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/7-effective-social-media-marketing-tips-enhance-online-business/"><strong>social media engagement</strong></a> that help a lot, but still, testing and tweaking the plan is the way to move forward.</p>
<p>A/B testing is a tried-and-tested strategy in the world of marketing, especially in today&#8217;s online marketing realm.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>
<p>The purpose of discussing the <em>attention trends that change</em> was to convey a message that <a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/anatomy-successful-digital-marketing-campaign/"><strong>digital marketing strategies</strong></a> always change over time as the attention of the consumer shifts.</p>
<p>Two decades ago, it was the radio that used to matter a lot. Today, it could be Instagram Stories that sending the waves out there.</p>
<p>The whole idea of this article was to ensure that brands should figure out where their audience exists and what kind of content they should develop to engage, attract, and convert the audience into customers.</p>
