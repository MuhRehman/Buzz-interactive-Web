								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the current onslaught of a huge chunk of internet users seeking fast, convenient and cost-effective services online &#8211; on-demand service is becoming more of a buzzword nowadays. The utility of on-demand service apps is simply undeniable because of the quality services they ensure.</p>
<p>Quality and shorter delivery time are in fact the main reasons why some of the on-demand apps have gathered immense popularity across the globe.</p>
<p>If you’re looking to launch an on-demand application service app &#8211; right now is a better time! In this blog, we’ll get to explore the types; recent trends; evolving opportunities; the business how to approach; and the growing importance of on-demand application builder community.</p>
<h2><strong>What On-Demand Service Apps are?</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It literally means a middle party software that acts as a source of connection between customers and service providers. On-demand services in simple words &#8211; facilitate communication &#8211; in audible, visual or textual forms &#8211; to get jobs done successfully.</p>
<p>Popular examples are Uber for taxis, Zomato for food, and Airbnb for hotels etc.</p>
<p>On-demand service platforms allow users to solve their daily problems. And in return, users are increasingly happy to pay for the services they get online. In this way, companies or on demand service providers grow their business reach and sales, and their customers find a convenient way of getting those services.</p>
<h3><strong>Why people use on demand delivery apps and what do they do on it:</strong></h3>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Reason for the popularity of these apps is the ‘instant problem solving value’ users get. So how do on-demand services actually turn inconveniences into solutions in just a few taps?</p>
<ul>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">“Oh no! I’ll be late, as it’s gonna take long for me to reach the bus stop. How about calling an Uber taxi to my current location &#8211; that’ll save me the time and effort”.</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">If I just order pizzas via Zomato app &#8211; I’ll be able to spend my full time with guests who have arrived already”.</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">“Now my inflexible job hours won’t hinder me from getting my father a regular medical check-up with Doctor on Demand app”.</li>
</ul>
<p>Above are just a few daily-life scenarios to quote.</p>
<p>Apart from getting the service, users also:</p>
<ul>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">Pay for services in the apps</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">Get real time notifications of service provider’s GPS location, time required, and audible, textual or even video communication and vice versa.</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">70% of the users use on-demand platforms to search for hiring services online, while 62% of them use on-demand apps to check the live status of the service they’ve ordered.</li>
</ul>
<h3></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Types and Nature of On-Demand Service Apps:</strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We can distinguish on-demand delivery apps into three forms depending on the nature of people involved:</p>
<ul>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">P2P (Person To Person): These on-demand service platforms allow individual users to exchange products with users.</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">Examples: Olx and eBay</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">B2B (Business To Business): These on-demand delivery apps are solely for supporting communication and service exchange between businesses.</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">Examples: Cargomatic and Catalant</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">B2P (Business To Person): B2P or B2C on-demand delivery apps facilitate services and products delivery from companies to customers. Meaning companies direct their employees to reach out and provide products and services to its customers and make money with it.</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">Examples: Uber and Booking.com</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>How Do On-Demand Service Apps Work? General Steps:</strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1- User places a request.</p>
<p>2- A service provider sees the request.</p>
<p>3- Provider accepts or declines the request (depending on the situation).</p>
<p>4- System shows payment for authorization.</p>
<p>5- Provider delivers the service or product after payment authorization.</p>
<p>6- Customer confirms the service delivery.</p>
<p>7- Payment then gets deducted.</p>

<h4><strong>Some Real Life Examples of Highly Successful On-demand Delivery Platforms and How They’re Influencing Major Industries:</strong></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Taxi Service</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>On <u>UBER</u><strong>, </strong>people can now request rides from any location on their smartphones and track the nearest available rides to go anywhere.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Food Delivery</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Apps like <u>Zomato</u> have made ordering, real time tracking and delivery of food a matter of several minutes  without the fatigue of actually going to a  takeaway.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Medical Services</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>With apps like <u>Doctor On Demand</u>, now there is less danger of not successfully tackling an emergency situation when any patient needs a doctor.</p>
<ul>

<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-19785 size-large" src="https://static.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/logos-1024x631.jpg" alt="Companies-Logo" width="1024" height="631" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/logos-1024x631.jpg 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/logos-300x185.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/logos-768x473.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/logos-700x431.jpg 700w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/logos.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Other big on-services industries include <u>fitness</u>, <u>maintenance</u>, <u>laundry</u>, <u>beauty &amp; Hair salon</u>, <u>pet care</u>, and the list continues.</p>
<h3><strong>Notable Statistical Trends In the On-demand Economy:</strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Annual Spending: </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>According to data collected by NTRS (National Technology Readiness Survey), the year 2017 saw an increase at a whopping 58% ($75.7) in total spending for on-demand (products and services) as compared to 2016.</p>
<p>These numbers are significantly growing for the market of on-demand apps in 2019 too &#8211; and are reported to reach a huge collective value of $335Billion by 2025 &#8211; according to PwC’s latest research.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>So are on-demand services gathering significant following?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The answer is a big YES. In America alone, around 7.6M Americans shall become providers of on-demand services.</p>
<p>Moreover, on-demand customers reached from 24.9 million in 2016 to 41.5 million in 2017. It’s surprising to see that more than 2 billion people used cellular devices to make a purchase worldwide &#8211; by the end of 2017.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Who are using on-demand platforms?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Millennials form the lion’s share of on-demand service seekers at 49%, whereas people between the ages of 35 to 54 make up 30% of the consumer quota.</p>
<h3><strong>Booming Importance of On-Demand App Developing Community</strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So what really makes the role of an on-demand app and <a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/web-development-services/">web development company</a> to gain so much importance in the world of app development? Well arguably it’s their different or rather specialized skill-set that’s crucial for developing on-demand service and delivery apps.</p>
<p>On-demand App creation is harder than creating a regular mobile app.</p>
<p>The maxim “necessity is the mother of invention” holds perfectly with how the on-demand market is growing so fast &#8211; and how businesses are finding more ways to deliver on-demand services.</p>
<p>In this scenario, it’s expected that the demand of programmers that specialize in Uber-like app creation &#8211; shall continue to rise.</p>
<h3><strong>How On-Demand Apps Benefit Different Groups:</strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Youth:</strong></p>
<p>The young generation is realizing how on-demand services provenly save a lot of time &#8211; while leaving ample room for getting other important things done &#8211; that ultimately have a direct effect on the quality of their lives. This on-demand trend is now seen by a lot of users as a way of uplifting their economic status.</p>
<p><strong>Businessmen / App Service Providers:</strong></p>
<p>51% of on-demand app providers shared that their financial situation has improved as compared to the last year 2018 (Burson Marsteller Survey) &#8211; while 64% expect the same &#8211; for the next year 2020.</p>
<p><strong>Employees:</strong></p>
<p>There has been a steady growth in the number of workers entering the stream of on-demand economy &#8211; every year. As of 2017 &#8211; up to 5.4 million employees were working in the on-demand market on record. This upward trend will absolutely hold strong in future.</p>
<p><strong>Skilled Workers:</strong></p>
<p>There’s going to be a high trend of more high skilled positions in the on-demand apps services. Take the health and medicine industry for example  &#8211; the on-demand nursing app named FRND developed to facilitate services of a certified nurse at home &#8211; who handles a wide range of specialized healthcare needs, is one example of a skill oriented on-demand job. So in the near future &#8211; as the on-demand economy enters more diverse industries &#8211; highly skilled positions will be in vogue.</p>
<p><strong>Is the On-demand Service Platform Worth Investing In:</strong></p>
<p>Absolutely yes! Reason being is that on-demand service is a game of providing the “value of convenience” to a population. Uber and Airbnb are superb examples of how these problem-solving on-demand service apps made things convenient for people &#8211; and speedily joined amongst the most widely used apps internationally.</p>
<p>Investment rounds focused on funding on-demand startups that started in 2014 ended with a figure of $74 billion and $102 Billion in the last quarter of 2017. Given the popularity, we can expect those numbers to keep growing significantly in 2019 and beyond.</p>
<p>Previously shared statistics speak volumes of the profit potential that the on-demand economy has. It only requires the research to understand the routine needs of people that can conveniently be fulfilled through an on-demand platform. And then of course &#8211; a team of professional developers from a <a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/">creative agency</a> along with investments to back the program.</p>
<h2><strong>Now If You’ve Decided To Make an On-demand App &#8211; See These Must Consider Prerequisite Steps You Can’t Afford to Miss:</strong></h2>
<h3></h3>
<h3></h3>
<h3></h3>
<h3><strong>Do a Market Research</strong></h3>
<h3></h3>
<h3></h3>
<h3><strong><em>Competitors:</em></strong></h3>
<p>Collect data and try to understand the various strategies that your competitors have applied in their business. Look out for all the weaknesses and mistakes your rivals made in their journey &#8211; so that you’re not doing any of that.</p>
<p>You can then come up with better strategies to avoid any grave losses and grow your business fast.</p>
<h3><em><strong>Understand Your Target Audience:</strong></em></h3>
<p>Your app’s success purely depends on this factor. Survey your audience and see how their behavior patterns revolve around how they would like an on-demand app to be like. What is it that they don’t find attractive or questions like what incentivizes them to happily use an on-demand service?</p>
<p>Analyze their real pain points and question them on what they really want. By doing this, you’ll be able to devise clear goals and strategies accordingly.</p>
<p>All this will help you to know what is popular and what is not. So then you can take a good decision about what kind of app and what service you’d seek to provide.</p>
<h3><strong><em>Choose the Optimal Features:</em></strong></h3>
<p>If you’re launching a new app and want to know its viability as early as possible &#8211; then go for an <strong>MVP</strong> (<strong>Minimum Viable Product</strong>) to just add the most important features and have a safe start.</p>
<p>Some not to be missed out features include:</p>
<ul>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">Convenient Registration Method:</li>
</ul>
<p>Registration is necessary for user profiles, ratings, personalized journey experience etc. It’s thus imperative to add an easy and straightforward registration login method &#8211; with any social media account or email address.</p>
<ul>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">Tracking / Geolocation</li>
</ul>
<p>The geographical closeness of a service provider on the map is essential for saving both the parties some valuable time. Especially in delivery and transportation services it’s a necessity to specify pickup locations and destinations. Watching your taxi coming on a screen map is a very interactive experience and the customers simply love it.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-19786 aligncenter" src="https://static.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/car-300x240.jpg" alt="Tracking Map" width="510" height="408" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/car-300x240.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/car.jpg 626w" sizes="(max-width: 510px) 100vw, 510px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">           <a href="https://www.pinterest.com">Source </a></p>
<ul>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">Notifications</li>
</ul>
<p>Push notices play a great role in customer experience. Notify the users regarding payments, ratings, and other essential things that sum up to a complete customer journey.</p>
<ul>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">Reliable and Easy Payments</li>
</ul>
<p>People tend to super conscious when there is anything that involves their money or identity. So your payment system should be transparent and as secure as you can make it &#8211; to develop trust in your services. The best way is to use online financial payment services that are already reputable &#8211; like paypal.</p>
<ul>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">Feed back</li>
</ul>
<p>This is simply the rates and reviews of your customers about your service. This also develops an understanding in your customers &#8211; about the fact that you care.</p>
<ul>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">Help &amp; Support</li>
</ul>
<p>Who can ever leave this portion when they are providing real time on-demand services online. This feature assists customers in case of any queries. This in turn, adds to the company’s reputation.</p>
<h4><strong><em><u>Wisely Choose Technologies To Be Used</u>:</em></strong></h4>
<p>On-demand service app creation requires parcels of innovations, depending on the choices of technology platforms. Moreover, choosing a technology stage to construct an app for is the foremost crucial part because it straightforwardly relates to customers&#8217; media experience. In this way, you must launch the app on platforms that are popular among your target audience and keep close consideration to tech-related details. Generally, there are three sorts of platforms you need to check-out:</p>
<ul>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">Web Platform (runs in a web browser)</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">Native Platform (iOS / Android)</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">Cross-Platform Technology (a cost-effective way for both iOS &amp; Android Apps)</li>
</ul>
<h4></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4></h4>
<h4></h4>
<h4><strong><em><u>Connect with the<a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co"> </a></u></em><em><u>Best Digit</u></em><em><u>a</u></em><em><u>l Agency Service Providers</u>:</em></strong></h4>
<p>Your service providers are the lifeline around which your whole business revolves. You can go with either of the two options in selecting your tech developer team:</p>
<p>1- <strong>In-house Teams: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">They can cater long-term projects with 24/7 support</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">It’s a more expensive option (you’ll be dealing with insurance, taxes, salaries, sick leaves and even vacations).</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2- <strong>Offshore Developers: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">A good choice for both long and short-term projects</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">Relatively economic (you’ll only pay against the amount of work done)</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">These teams are readily willing to sign a contract for the safety of both the parties</li>
</ul>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s fascinating to see that we’re surrounded by so many engagement and lead generation opportunities in today’s world, but the majority of businesses are still missing out a whole heap of revenue either by not having a website up and running or not improvising the best practices.</p>
<p>As marketing paradigms are changing, digital marketing is becoming relevant more than ever. It’s necessary to start off on the right foot when it comes to developing a website because the website does play a vital role in the <a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/5-out-of-the-box-digital-marketing-examples-from-2018/">digital marketing campaign</a> for any business.</p>
<p>The idea is to make your website engaging so that it intrigues visitors to explore, take action, and respond. To make that happen, we need to make the website communicate to the visitors in a way that it leads to engagement. The reason for emphasizing a lot on websites communication is that if it doesn’t stand out or attract visitors, then they’ll walk off the site. Not only does it require the website design to be subtle, but it also takes a solid website copy to get the job done.</p>
<p><em>Have you ever come across websites that have a difficult layout to navigate through?</em></p>
<p><em>Did you visit some websites that don’t clarify what they’re about?</em></p>
<p>Perhaps, we often stumble upon such websites that miss out lots of opportunities just because they don’t communicate well with the visitors.</p>
<p>In this blog post, we’re going to take a closer look at the elements that make websites communicates well and help businesses start the process of lead generation through websites. Here are some of the best strategies to achieve those goals:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>1 &#8211; Attractive Design and Layout</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-17212" src="https://static1.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Attractive-Design-1024x360.jpg" alt="Attractive Design" width="1024" height="360" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Attractive-Design-1024x360.jpg 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Attractive-Design-300x105.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Attractive-Design-768x270.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Attractive-Design-700x246.jpg 700w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Attractive-Design.jpg 1266w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Whenever a visitor lands on a website, the website design plays the role of a pivotal point. If the website design seems attractive and innovative, the visitor might stay longer unless the website isn’t slow. The science behind this is that the creativity in the web design might keep the visitor engaged for a little while. It doesn’t mean that the website design will hold on the visitor for minutes. Instead, it’ll be a matter of a few seconds.</p>
<p>What an <a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/web-development-services/"><strong>attractive web design</strong></a> could do is lead the visitor into a communication funnel such as filling up a form, moving to contact page, or signing up for the newsletter. It does look very simple, but in reality, it is not that easy to make it happen. It’s true that the website design alone can’t make visitors convert into subscribers or leads unless the message doesn’t resonate with the audience. The design isn’t the only key to the engagement. You’ll find out more in the next points.</p>

<h3>2 &#8211; Writing a Perfect Copy</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-17213" src="https://static2.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Writing-a-Perfect-Copy-1024x360.jpg" alt="Writing a Perfect Copy" width="1024" height="360" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Writing-a-Perfect-Copy-1024x360.jpg 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Writing-a-Perfect-Copy-300x105.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Writing-a-Perfect-Copy-768x270.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Writing-a-Perfect-Copy-700x246.jpg 700w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Writing-a-Perfect-Copy.jpg 1266w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>The most important thing after the website design and layout is the website copy. Not only does it translate your vision into words, but it also helps you send the message across. A website copy isn’t the longest form of content, so it has to be precise and to the point. The key here is to write a clear, concise, and understandable message. The problem with some websites either they go with a generic style of copy or opt to put out technically written content. So it doesn’t help either way.</p>
<p>On the other side, if the copy is simple, actionable, and enticing, then it impacts differently. One of the important goals of getting a website developed and optimized in the <a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/anatomy-successful-digital-marketing-campaign/"><strong>digital marketing campaign is that it communicates with the prospects</strong></a> and if the copy hinders that communication for whatever reason, and then there is no point of having a website.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>3 &#8211; Optin Forms and Popups</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-17214" src="https://static2.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Optin-Forms-1024x360.jpg" alt="Optin Forms" width="1024" height="360" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Optin-Forms-1024x360.jpg 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Optin-Forms-300x105.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Optin-Forms-768x270.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Optin-Forms-700x246.jpg 700w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Optin-Forms.jpg 1266w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Optin forms and popups work as a funnel in the lead generation process. After <a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/design-services/">website design</a> and copy, the optin strategy is an essential thing to take care of in the online marketing process. When the visitors land on the website and consume the content, the chances are they’ll walk away. What an optin form or popup does is that it builds a connection with the visitor through adding them to the email list.</p>
<p>It doesn’t happen so quickly. The visitors won’t sign up to the email list if there is no proper funnel is created, let alone if the right message on the optin form is not there. The process of highlighting the importance of optin forms is that website communication isn’t just about the website design and copy; instead, optins play a crucial role in converting visitors into leads.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>4 &#8211; Adding Call-to-Action Buttons</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-17215" src="https://static3.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Call-to-Action-Buttons-1024x360.jpg" alt="Call-to-Action Buttons" width="1024" height="360" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Call-to-Action-Buttons-1024x360.jpg 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Call-to-Action-Buttons-300x105.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Call-to-Action-Buttons-768x270.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Call-to-Action-Buttons-700x246.jpg 700w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Call-to-Action-Buttons.jpg 1266w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Call-to-Action buttons are imperative to build an interactive environment for engagement. Sometimes a well-written copy engages the visitors and put them on the conveyor belt to contact you. Then you need the right call-to-actions at the right spot to make the communication possible. If a call-to-action (CTA) isn’t there for visitors to check out, then either they will instantaneously leave without taking action or they’ll end up frustrated and leave the site forever.</p>
<p>There is another side of the story – you just don’t have to put any CTA on your website. In fact, it does have to be a relevant CTA. There is a wide range of CTAs that different brands use according to their need. For example, get a quote, talk to us, live chat, free report are a few popular ones. Don’t hesitate to experiment with some new ones. The truth is that CTA ignites the process of lead generation and the digital marketing strategy is incomplete without tools like call-to-action.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>5 &#8211; Install Necessary Analytics</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-17216" src="https://static3.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Necessary-Analytics-1024x360.jpg" alt="Necessary Analytics" width="1024" height="360" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Necessary-Analytics-1024x360.jpg 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Necessary-Analytics-300x105.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Necessary-Analytics-768x270.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Necessary-Analytics-700x246.jpg 700w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Necessary-Analytics.jpg 1266w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Analytics will allow the website owner to understand how the website is performing on the web. Analytics refers to the various forms of website traffic analysis and tracking. Besides regular tracking, Heatmap is a new web technology that tracks what portion of the website most visitors are spending time on and clicking as well. So analytics will help guide the website owners not just to create relevant content, but also to optimize the website elements to increase the click-through rate. Therefore, it becomes easier to figure out what kind of content visitors are looking at and CTAs they are clicking through.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>You have learned five basic elements that make communication with the visitors seamless. If you pay attention to these elements; you’ll see an increase in the lead generation process.</p>
<p>The purpose of discussing the whole topic was to ensure that your website does engagement, which results in more leads along the way. It wouldn’t have been possible without having a beautifully-designed website and the rest of the steps mentioned in this blog post.</p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s astonishing to see how marketing is changing rapidly. The shift from TV commercials and billboards to Snapchat Ads and Facebook Ads is fascinating to see. What the question arises is that how long it would last. What we need to do in this very moment of time is that we should start paying attention to what the people from 13 to 55 are looking at and what tools they&#8217;re using to socialize when they&#8217;re holding their smartphones.</p>
<p>In the pre-social media world, meaning, before 2003, things were quite different, let alone the online marketing wasn&#8217;t impacting at scale. Then comes the social media; Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter were born. The global connectivity went to a new height. Besides that, the attention arbitrage started to change, meaning, calling cards, internet cards, SMS, MSN Messenger, Yahoo Messenger, and ICQ got replaced by the WhatsApp, WeChat, Viber, Skype, and Facetime. We all have seen and lived through that transition.</p>
<p>Then, another attention arbitrage change happened in the recent time when TV commercials, cable TV, DVD/BlueRay got replaced by Netflix, iflix, Hulu, YouTube, and Facebook.</p>
<p>So new age marketing refers to the ever-changing attention phenomenon that we need to understand in today&#8217;s mobile-internet world, where people are using the 4G internet and the internet is being used on mobile devices more than the desktop computers.</p>
<p>Before going into the rabbit hole of using the power of content that brands need to understand; we should look at the types of content that brands and entrepreneurs can utilize to engage, attract, and convert the audience into customers:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-17118 size-full" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/inbound-marketing.jpg" alt="inbound marketing" width="1266" height="500" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/inbound-marketing.jpg 1266w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/inbound-marketing-300x118.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/inbound-marketing-768x303.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/inbound-marketing-1024x404.jpg 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/inbound-marketing-700x276.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1266px) 100vw, 1266px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong> Written content</strong>: It&#8217;s the text-form content such as website content, blog posts, white papers, and ebooks. Any online platform that engages the audience through text content comes in the written content ecosystem.</li>
<li><strong> Video content</strong>: One of the emerging forms of the online content is the video. Brands utilize videos on various platforms like YouTube, Vimeo, Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram, and Twitter to deliver the message across.</li>
<li><strong> Visual content</strong>: It&#8217;s a graphical and illustrative content that is used to engage and educate the prospective audience. For example, infographics, photos, and illustration are the obvious choices in this regard.</li>
<li><strong> Audio content</strong>: The fourth and rapidly growing form of content is the audio. Podcasting is one of the famous examples of the audio content. It&#8217;s an on-demand radio that you can listen to on your smartphone or computer.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These are the fundamental tools of content marketing that play a huge role in the <a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/social-media-services/"><strong>social media marketing </strong></a>campaign &#8211; either you can choose a single one or go with testing out more than one. Either way, it&#8217;s imperative to understand the power of content.</p>
<p>Here is the step-by-step process of using the power of content</p>
<h3><strong>1 &#8211; Discover Your Market Segment</strong></h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-17119 size-full" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/market-segments.jpg" alt="market segments" width="1266" height="500" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/market-segments.jpg 1266w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/market-segments-300x118.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/market-segments-768x303.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/market-segments-1024x404.jpg 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/market-segments-700x276.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1266px) 100vw, 1266px" /></p>
<p>The first and the foremost step you should take in the modern-day marketing is identifying the target audience. It becomes the key to everything you should be doing in your marketing. If you follow the wrong trail all along, you&#8217;ll waste time.</p>
<p>Discovering the marketing segment means:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who you want to reach out</li>
<li>What the audience age group is</li>
<li>Where they belong to (income and status-wise)</li>
<li>What their likes and dislikes are</li>
<li>What social media platforms they use</li>
<li>What they consume online</li>
<li>Where they hang out</li>
<li>What sports they follow</li>
<li>What celebs they look up to</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Such demographic data will give you an insight into prospective audience characteristics. It&#8217;s true that it would require predictions and emotional intelligence to tap into the right kind of people that might be interested in your product or service.</p>
<p>The key benefit of developing the valuable content is that it hits the target audience and solves the problem. The authenticity, however, is determined by the impact it creates in the form of engagement and social sharing. Either you outsource from a <a href="http://www.buzzinteractive.co/"><strong>digital marketing agency</strong></a> or hire a social media marketing expert &#8211; it doesn&#8217;t matter. The narrative should be in-line with your brand&#8217;s vision.</p>
<h3><strong>2 &#8211; </strong><strong>Choose the Right Content Type</strong></h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-17120 size-full" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/content-writing.jpg" alt="content writing" width="1266" height="500" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/content-writing.jpg 1266w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/content-writing-300x118.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/content-writing-768x303.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/content-writing-1024x404.jpg 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/content-writing-700x276.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1266px) 100vw, 1266px" /></p>
<p>The power of content could go off the grid if you&#8217;re serving the wrong type of content to the audience. They won&#8217;t respond or even notice your content, no matter how great and useful the content is. For example, if you&#8217;re a SAAS company and you&#8217;re entirely focusing on written tutorials rather than having a mix of video and written content, then you&#8217;re making a mistake because people might want to see how your online software works. They&#8217;d rather watch a &#8220;how to get started&#8221; video than reading the in-depth blog post about it.</p>
<p>The power of content doesn&#8217;t mean you can pick up any content format and start pumping out content without a plan.</p>
<p>Let’s take the example of <a href="https://www.hubspot.com/">Hubspot</a>. They focus on written content a lot, but they also have video and visuals in their marketing strategy.</p>
<p>Another example is <a href="https://www.smartpassiveincome.com/">Pat Flynn</a> who started off with a blog, then diversified the business. He got into podcasting, and now the podcast is his main focus.</p>
<h3><strong>3 &#8211; Deliver Unconditional Value</strong></h3>
<p>One of the reasons people would stick to your content is that you&#8217;ll be sharing information that matters to them. It&#8217;s the most underrated success hacks out there &#8212; because everybody is going after the best selling techniques and running ads. Whereas, what they should do is sit down for a while and think what they could tell the audience that benefit them and they would come running for more.</p>
<p>Once you develop a habit of giving to others, not only will they pay attention to you, but they would also tell their friends to check you out.</p>
<p><em>Gary Vaynerchuk</em>&#8216;s book &#8220;<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17383989-jab-jab-jab-right-hook">Jab, Jab, Jab, Right Hook</a>&#8221; helps social media marketers understand the importance of building a relationship over adopting sales strategies to get the transaction. This book is a great piece of advice for everyone who wants to crush social media game by putting compelling content out there because it will teach you that besides content, how you can build relationships with customers and knock out the competition.</p>
<p>Another book is &#8220;<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16158498-give-and-take">Give and Take</a>&#8221; by <em>Adam Grant</em>. The genre of this book is business development. The author talked about the value of giving and how givers outsmart the takers and matchers.</p>
<p><em>Brandon Hood</em> rightly <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpN_Vk9CfYM">said</a>, &#8220;Impact is the only thing that will bring the numbers in.&#8221;</p>
<h3><strong>4 &#8211; Test and Analyze</strong></h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-17121 size-full" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/analyzing-marketing-trends.jpg" alt="analyzing marketing trends" width="1266" height="500" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/analyzing-marketing-trends.jpg 1266w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/analyzing-marketing-trends-300x118.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/analyzing-marketing-trends-768x303.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/analyzing-marketing-trends-1024x404.jpg 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/analyzing-marketing-trends-700x276.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1266px) 100vw, 1266px" /></p>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve got a strategy in place, don&#8217;t romanticize with the plan, just test it out and feel free to tweak it, if required. Many entrepreneurs and social media managers design a campaign and they keep their fingers crossed and hope that it would work. A bunch of strategies work and dozens of strategies fail as well.</p>
<p>For instance, if you started focusing on certain keywords in your content, it won&#8217;t guarantee that your blog posts will start to rank immediately. In fact, your specific blog post that you&#8217;re dying to rank on the first page may not rank, and a randomly posted blog post may get better ranking. However, there are techniques that SEOs apply such as site authority, backlinks, and <a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/7-effective-social-media-marketing-tips-enhance-online-business/"><strong>social media engagement</strong></a> that help a lot, but still, testing and tweaking the plan is the way to move forward.</p>
<p>A/B testing is a tried-and-tested strategy in the world of marketing, especially in today&#8217;s online marketing realm.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>
<p>The purpose of discussing the <em>attention trends that change</em> was to convey a message that <a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/anatomy-successful-digital-marketing-campaign/"><strong>digital marketing strategies</strong></a> always change over time as the attention of the consumer shifts.</p>
<p>Two decades ago, it was the radio that used to matter a lot. Today, it could be Instagram Stories that sending the waves out there.</p>
<p>The whole idea of this article was to ensure that brands should figure out where their audience exists and what kind of content they should develop to engage, attract, and convert the audience into customers.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Digital marketing is one of the emerging communication mediums of this era of technology and social media. Nowadays, brands use multiple tactics to win the attention by giving away what matters the most to the audience. The arbitrage of attention and value between the customers and brands is what that is redefining the business development and marketing strategies.</p>
<p>A successful digital marketing campaign refers to the fruitful engagement of the prospective customers on the internet. However, the digital marketing doesn’t always provide outcome on the financial side, but sometimes it’s related to brand positioning and recognition.</p>
<p>Every company’s digital marketing campaign is unique, not to mention their methods are always different. In some cases, it is quite possible that the agency that is designing the whole campaign drives the whole strategy. On the other hand, some brands prefer to define their <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/digital-marketing-tactics-win-brand-war-muhammad-gohar-shafique/">digital marketing strategy</a> based on the consensus between the brand and agency.</p>
<p>Pay close attention if you’re a brand and haven’t had a chance to run a digital marketing campaign either through any <a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/"><strong>digital marketing agency</strong></a> or in-house staff.</p>
<p>Following are the basics of running a successful digital marketing campaign:</p>
<h3>1- Understanding the Brand Identity</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-17069 size-full" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/brand-identity.jpg" alt="brand identity" width="1266" height="500" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/brand-identity.jpg 1266w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/brand-identity-300x118.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/brand-identity-768x303.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/brand-identity-1024x404.jpg 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/brand-identity-700x276.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1266px) 100vw, 1266px" /></p>
<p>It’s true that digital marketing revolves around various forms of communication such as content creation, online advertising, and social media, but to start off on the right foot, a brand must figure out its identity. If a brand doesn’t know about its value proposition, target audience, competitive edge, and competition, then it won’t be able to make an impact. So understanding the brand identity means getting to know the brand inside out. If the team behind a brand knows these elements, they can certainly pull this off the right way. It’s easy to decide whether you should run ads on Facebook or Google or Twitter, but understanding the brand’s identity is somewhat that comes before hopping onto any advertising platform. A successful digital marketing campaign is built on acknowledging the message that the brand has to convey what differentiates them from the competition.</p>
<h3>2- Delivering the Value</h3>

<p>Digital marketing is a multi-dimensional strategy, and every individual brand chooses a specific area to go all in. Without embracing the brand identity and without being aware of the strengths, it becomes difficult for a brand to put something out for the audience to consume. However, delivering the value is one of the most important aspects of digital marketing. A campaign, for example, a Facebook video ad may not get traction if it doesn’t stand out or not reaching to the right audience. A brand must find out what kind of content such as written, audio, video, or graphical resonates with its audience because that’s the way forward to providing the right type of information the audience is expecting to get. It won’t be unfair to say that any valuable piece of content that provides the value upfront has a better chance to perform well than the clickable banner ad that could lead to somewhere else. Provide value upfront and build your brand’s momentum on top of that rather than being salesy and directly selling the product through online advertising. Have you seen some YouTube pre-roll ads that have a useful message to share and perhaps we watch the ad? So the successful digital marketing campaign must be delivering the value without asking for asking anything in return, at least, for the time being.</p>
<h3>3- Igniting the Engagement</h3>

<p>A digital marketing campaign can’t be considered a success unless it entices people to respond mostly in a positive manner. People react to the extremely positive, negative, or helpful things they see on the internet. Most of the brands like to touch the helpful or positive section of the chart. So if a campaign whether it’s an ad, article, infographic, video, or an audio creates a buzz around and arouses people to react to it, then it’s serving its purpose.</p>
<h3>4- Solving a Problem</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-17072 size-full" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/problem-solving-idea.jpg" alt="problem solving idea" width="1266" height="500" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/problem-solving-idea.jpg 1266w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/problem-solving-idea-300x118.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/problem-solving-idea-768x303.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/problem-solving-idea-1024x404.jpg 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/problem-solving-idea-700x276.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1266px) 100vw, 1266px" /></p>
<p>Whether you’re doing video marketing, content marketing, infographics, visuals, or podcasting, you can create a robust digital marketing campaign around any medium of content creation you choose. The only thing that matters is becoming the part of the solution. If your talks or written words or images solve any problem of the right audience, you’re all good. A highly cinematic video ad may get attention in the beginning, but if the message is unclear, then the brand won’t reap the benefits later. The reason for this is that the majority of people might get confused with the message or interpret it wrong. So ambiguity leads to low response rate. On the flip side, if the message is clear and resonates with the audience, it could lead to virality. Therefore, to make it  successful, one must clarify the message to ensure that it solves the problem.</p>
<h3>5- Analyzing the Outcome</h3>

<p>One of the perks of a successful digital marketing campaign is that you get to see things that worked well for your brand’s marketing. If you’re emphasizing a lot on written content and the certain type of articles are performing better than the others, then you can create relevant content so that it doubles down the impact. There are no specific tools to analyze the outcome. However, a lot of SEO results could be seen through Ahrefs, SEMrush, and Majestic tools. It comes down to every individual brand’s choice. Maybe, a brand is looking at its Google Analytics to gather the traffic data, and the other brand is keen to collect the email subscribers’ data through email marketing software like MailChimp or Aweber, whereas maybe another brand is following the Facebook ad statistics to hone the ad strategy. The critical part is the analysis of the outcome, which may lead to improving the whole campaign.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>A digital marketing campaign comprises of various components. Every brand chooses to focus on the specific type of content to produce, publish, and promote. Once they put it out there, they need to leverage the content by taking it in front of the right kind of eyeballs. To make that happen, either they choose online advertising or search engine optimization or content marketing to win the attention of the prospective clients.</p>
<p>A successful digital marketing campaign, however, doesn’t guarantee the financial transaction, but it instead builds a relationship between the brand and the audience.</p>
