								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s fascinating to see that we’re surrounded by so many engagement and lead generation opportunities in today’s world, but the majority of businesses are still missing out a whole heap of revenue either by not having a website up and running or not improvising the best practices.</p>
<p>As marketing paradigms are changing, digital marketing is becoming relevant more than ever. It’s necessary to start off on the right foot when it comes to developing a website because the website does play a vital role in the <a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/5-out-of-the-box-digital-marketing-examples-from-2018/">digital marketing campaign</a> for any business.</p>
<p>The idea is to make your website engaging so that it intrigues visitors to explore, take action, and respond. To make that happen, we need to make the website communicate to the visitors in a way that it leads to engagement. The reason for emphasizing a lot on websites communication is that if it doesn’t stand out or attract visitors, then they’ll walk off the site. Not only does it require the website design to be subtle, but it also takes a solid website copy to get the job done.</p>
<p><em>Have you ever come across websites that have a difficult layout to navigate through?</em></p>
<p><em>Did you visit some websites that don’t clarify what they’re about?</em></p>
<p>Perhaps, we often stumble upon such websites that miss out lots of opportunities just because they don’t communicate well with the visitors.</p>
<p>In this blog post, we’re going to take a closer look at the elements that make websites communicates well and help businesses start the process of lead generation through websites. Here are some of the best strategies to achieve those goals:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>1 &#8211; Attractive Design and Layout</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-17212" src="https://static1.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Attractive-Design-1024x360.jpg" alt="Attractive Design" width="1024" height="360" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Attractive-Design-1024x360.jpg 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Attractive-Design-300x105.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Attractive-Design-768x270.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Attractive-Design-700x246.jpg 700w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Attractive-Design.jpg 1266w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Whenever a visitor lands on a website, the website design plays the role of a pivotal point. If the website design seems attractive and innovative, the visitor might stay longer unless the website isn’t slow. The science behind this is that the creativity in the web design might keep the visitor engaged for a little while. It doesn’t mean that the website design will hold on the visitor for minutes. Instead, it’ll be a matter of a few seconds.</p>
<p>What an <a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/web-development-services/"><strong>attractive web design</strong></a> could do is lead the visitor into a communication funnel such as filling up a form, moving to contact page, or signing up for the newsletter. It does look very simple, but in reality, it is not that easy to make it happen. It’s true that the website design alone can’t make visitors convert into subscribers or leads unless the message doesn’t resonate with the audience. The design isn’t the only key to the engagement. You’ll find out more in the next points.</p>

<h3>2 &#8211; Writing a Perfect Copy</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-17213" src="https://static2.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Writing-a-Perfect-Copy-1024x360.jpg" alt="Writing a Perfect Copy" width="1024" height="360" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Writing-a-Perfect-Copy-1024x360.jpg 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Writing-a-Perfect-Copy-300x105.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Writing-a-Perfect-Copy-768x270.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Writing-a-Perfect-Copy-700x246.jpg 700w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Writing-a-Perfect-Copy.jpg 1266w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>The most important thing after the website design and layout is the website copy. Not only does it translate your vision into words, but it also helps you send the message across. A website copy isn’t the longest form of content, so it has to be precise and to the point. The key here is to write a clear, concise, and understandable message. The problem with some websites either they go with a generic style of copy or opt to put out technically written content. So it doesn’t help either way.</p>
<p>On the other side, if the copy is simple, actionable, and enticing, then it impacts differently. One of the important goals of getting a website developed and optimized in the <a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/anatomy-successful-digital-marketing-campaign/"><strong>digital marketing campaign is that it communicates with the prospects</strong></a> and if the copy hinders that communication for whatever reason, and then there is no point of having a website.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>3 &#8211; Optin Forms and Popups</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-17214" src="https://static2.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Optin-Forms-1024x360.jpg" alt="Optin Forms" width="1024" height="360" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Optin-Forms-1024x360.jpg 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Optin-Forms-300x105.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Optin-Forms-768x270.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Optin-Forms-700x246.jpg 700w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Optin-Forms.jpg 1266w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Optin forms and popups work as a funnel in the lead generation process. After <a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/design-services/">website design</a> and copy, the optin strategy is an essential thing to take care of in the online marketing process. When the visitors land on the website and consume the content, the chances are they’ll walk away. What an optin form or popup does is that it builds a connection with the visitor through adding them to the email list.</p>
<p>It doesn’t happen so quickly. The visitors won’t sign up to the email list if there is no proper funnel is created, let alone if the right message on the optin form is not there. The process of highlighting the importance of optin forms is that website communication isn’t just about the website design and copy; instead, optins play a crucial role in converting visitors into leads.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>4 &#8211; Adding Call-to-Action Buttons</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-17215" src="https://static3.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Call-to-Action-Buttons-1024x360.jpg" alt="Call-to-Action Buttons" width="1024" height="360" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Call-to-Action-Buttons-1024x360.jpg 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Call-to-Action-Buttons-300x105.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Call-to-Action-Buttons-768x270.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Call-to-Action-Buttons-700x246.jpg 700w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Call-to-Action-Buttons.jpg 1266w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Call-to-Action buttons are imperative to build an interactive environment for engagement. Sometimes a well-written copy engages the visitors and put them on the conveyor belt to contact you. Then you need the right call-to-actions at the right spot to make the communication possible. If a call-to-action (CTA) isn’t there for visitors to check out, then either they will instantaneously leave without taking action or they’ll end up frustrated and leave the site forever.</p>
<p>There is another side of the story – you just don’t have to put any CTA on your website. In fact, it does have to be a relevant CTA. There is a wide range of CTAs that different brands use according to their need. For example, get a quote, talk to us, live chat, free report are a few popular ones. Don’t hesitate to experiment with some new ones. The truth is that CTA ignites the process of lead generation and the digital marketing strategy is incomplete without tools like call-to-action.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>5 &#8211; Install Necessary Analytics</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-17216" src="https://static3.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Necessary-Analytics-1024x360.jpg" alt="Necessary Analytics" width="1024" height="360" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Necessary-Analytics-1024x360.jpg 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Necessary-Analytics-300x105.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Necessary-Analytics-768x270.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Necessary-Analytics-700x246.jpg 700w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Necessary-Analytics.jpg 1266w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Analytics will allow the website owner to understand how the website is performing on the web. Analytics refers to the various forms of website traffic analysis and tracking. Besides regular tracking, Heatmap is a new web technology that tracks what portion of the website most visitors are spending time on and clicking as well. So analytics will help guide the website owners not just to create relevant content, but also to optimize the website elements to increase the click-through rate. Therefore, it becomes easier to figure out what kind of content visitors are looking at and CTAs they are clicking through.</p>
