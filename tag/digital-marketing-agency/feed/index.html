								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Online presence is one of the most important, and perhaps most underutilized, tools to ensure success in today’s increasingly digital marketplace. Not only should it be easy to find your business online, but there should also be something clear and unique waiting for them at the end of their search. SEO, web design and digital marketing are key components in cultivating a <u><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/drewhendricks/2015/02/11/understanding-the-full-impact-of-web-design-on-seo-branding-and-more/?utm_source=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buzzinteractive.co&amp;utm_medium=BuzzBlog#360dd7cc64fe">robust digital presence</a></u>, and they are more connected than most understand. We are a team of designers, developers, and marketers, dedicated to providing our clients with personalized and unparalleled <a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/?utm_source=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buzzinteractive.co&amp;utm_medium=BuzzBlog&amp;utm_campaign=Clutch%20PR">digital marketing services</a>.</p>
<p>According to Clutch, a B2B ratings and reviews platform, Buzz Interactive is one of the top <u><a href="https://clutch.co/pk/agencies/digital-marketing?sort_by=field_pp_rank_digital_marketing&amp;field_pp_min_project_size=All&amp;field_pp_hrly_rate_range=All&amp;field_pp_size_people=All&amp;field_pp_cs_small_biz=&amp;field_pp_cs_midmarket=&amp;field_pp_cs_enterprise=&amp;client_focus=&amp;field_pp_if_advertising=&amp;field_pp_if_automotive=&amp;field_pp_if_arts=&amp;field_pp_if_bizservices=&amp;field_pp_if_conproducts=&amp;field_pp_if_education=&amp;field_pp_if_natural_resources=&amp;field_pp_if_finservices=&amp;field_pp_if_gambling=&amp;field_pp_if_gaming=&amp;field_pp_if_government=&amp;field_pp_if_healthcare=&amp;field_pp_if_hospitality=&amp;field_pp_if_it=&amp;field_pp_if_legal=&amp;field_pp_if_manufacturing=&amp;field_pp_if_media=&amp;field_pp_if_nonprofit=&amp;field_pp_if_realestate=&amp;field_pp_if_retail=&amp;field_pp_if_telecom=&amp;field_pp_if_transportation=&amp;field_pp_if_utilities=&amp;field_pp_if_other=&amp;industry_focus=&amp;field_pp_location_country_select=All&amp;field_pp_location_province=&amp;field_pp_location_latlon_1%5Bpostal_code%5D=&amp;field_pp_location_latlon_1%5Bsearch_distance%5D=100&amp;field_pp_location_latlon_1%5Bsearch_units%5D=mile&amp;utm_source=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buzzinteractive.co&amp;utm_medium=BuzzBlog&amp;utm_campaign=Clutch%20PR">digital marketing agencies in Pakistan</a></u>.

<p>Although analysts at Clutch evaluate service providers, the main purpose of the platform is to give clients an opportunity to review the firms that they have worked with. We value the opportunity to hear what our clients think of our services, and we are pleased that one of our clients has taken the time to share their experience with us. When asked about their time working with us, one client spoke to the level of attention they received, saying, “I would call or text them even when it was not their office hours, and they were polite enough to reply back the very second I sent them a message about anything.” We pride ourselves on our ability to provide the expertise of a large agency with a high level of personal attention for every client, and we are excited that our clients have taken notice.</p>
<p>We have also been recognized for our ability to leverage existing platforms to help our clients grow their businesses.

LinkedIn is one of the best ways to market to other businesses, and we have been featured as one of the best LinkedIn marketers in the world. We were highlighted by <u><a href="https://themanifest.com/linkedin-marketing/agencies?utm_source=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buzzinteractive.co&amp;utm_medium=BuzzBlog&amp;utm_campaign=Clutch%20PR#buzzinteractive" class="broken_link">The Manifest</a></u> as one of the top LinkedIn marketing firms in the world.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are barely halfway through 2018 and already there have been several digital marketing examples that have raised the bar high. By tapping into trends and sharing engaging stories through multiple platforms, these out-of-the-box marketing campaigns used a variety of themes and styles to help organizations generate a lot of buzz around their message, product, and brand.</p>
<p>With 61 percent of marketers citing their top inbound marketing priority is to improve SEO (search engine optimization) and grow their organic presence according to <a href="http://www.stateofinbound.com/?__hstc=20629287.2307c00a75951ac412f22e5d6a630011.1509885237296.1524474170816.1524663373158.4&amp;__hssc=20629287.1.1524663373158&amp;__hsfp=962579618">HubSpot’s 2017 State of Inbound report</a>, the <a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/anatomy-successful-digital-marketing-campaign/">digital marketing campaigns</a> need to drive engagement by evoking emotions and capturing the imagination of the target audience. Why? Because impactful campaigns sway customers when they are making purchase decisions.</p>
<p>To help you out, here we have aligned five out-of-the-box digital marketing examples from 2018 (thus far), so you cans see what strategies they have used to influence the users.</p>
<h3><strong>1. ABTA Jumps on the ‘#footselfie’ Bandwagon to Lure Holidaymakers</strong></h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-18252 size-full" src="https://static.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/1.png" alt=" digital marketing campaign" width="589" height="410" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/1.png 589w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/1-300x209.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 589px) 100vw, 589px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Image Credit: </strong><a href="http://contentworks.agency/5-tourism-brands-who-get-social-media/?utm_source=BuzzInteractive.co&amp;utm_medium=BuzzBlog&amp;utm_campaign=intuit%20brand%20mentions"><strong>ContentWorks</strong></a></p>
<p>Last year, ABTA, a renowned association of travel agents and tour operations in the United Kingdom, launched a campaign on Boxing Day to highlight why vacationers should book with an ABTA member throughout January.</p>
<p>The campaign was named ‘Travel with Confidence’. The <strong><a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/">digital marketing agency</a></strong> handling the campaign tapped into the social media trend of taking ‘footselfies’ to show the wide array of destinations from ABTA brands. Besides this, they also promoted the hashtag #beABTAsmart and arranged a competition for social media users which gave them the opportunity to win several prizes.</p>
<h3><strong>2.Intuit Creates an Animated Movie to Get its Idea Across </strong></h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-18253 size-full" src="https://static1.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/2.jpg" alt="digital marketing agency " width="720" height="720" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/2.jpg 720w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/2-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/2-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/2-570x570.jpg 570w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/2-500x500.jpg 500w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/2-700x700.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Image Credit: </strong><a href="https://intuitblog.com/?utm_source=BuzzInteractive.co&amp;utm_medium=BuzzBlog&amp;utm_campaign=intuit%20brand%20mentions"><strong>Intuit</strong></a></p>
<p>Intuit — that develops and sells tax preparation, accounting, and financial software to individuals and small businesses — launched a new brand campaign this year. The first part of the campaign comprises a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktafrbsKeZw">short animated story of two business owners</a> that was showcased at the 2018 Super Bowl.</p>
<p>The idea was to bring all of Intuit’s brands together, including <a href="https://quickbooks.intuit.com/?utm_source=BuzzInteractive.co&amp;utm_medium=BuzzBlog&amp;utm_campaign=intuit%20brand%20mentions">Quickbooks</a>, <a href="https://www.mint.com/?utm_source=BuzzInteractive.co&amp;utm_medium=BuzzBlog&amp;utm_campaign=intuit%20brand%20mentions">Mint</a>, and <a href="https://turbotax.intuit.com/?utm_source=BuzzInteractive.co&amp;utm_medium=BuzzBlog&amp;utm_campaign=intuit%20brand%20mentions">TurboTax</a>. Since millions of people were using Intuit’s products, but only four out of every thousand users were leveraging two or more of them. So the brand took the leap of faith and attempted to show the audience that its products are best when used together.</p>
<p>To represent the power of its products, the company’s digital marketing agency created a character of a giant robot in the animated movie. The agency believed animation was the best way to get Intuit’s idea across. The 15-second teaser was run during the Super Bowl LII, driving users back to the full film online.</p>
<p>In addition, the social media campaign of the brand featured a Snapchat filter showcasing the Intuit Giant. The robot was used as a symbol in the campaign showcasing how the brand’s services harness technology to make financial processes easy-peasy for its users. The animated movie revolves around Pete, a flower shop owner, who fails to find time to enjoy his outside passions owing to his frantic schedule and Pari, an engineer and entrepreneur, who is keen to help him by creating the Intuit Giant.</p>
<p>Shedding light on the target audience for the marketing campaign, the chief marketing officer, Lucas Watson divulged there are 750 million people around the globe that work for themselves and manage their finances while chasing their passions. Unfortunately, the pressure of managing time and money sometimes makes them feel as if the odds are stacked against them.</p>
<p>The campaign has worked wonders for the brand so it will continue to use it throughout the year. In fact, Intuit will work on additional channels and executions to promote its cohort of services.</p>
<h3><strong>3. Dollar Shave Club Marks its Arrival in the UK with a Creative Campaign</strong></h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-18254 size-full" src="https://static2.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Dollar-Shave-Club-Marks-its-Arrival-in-the-UK-with-a-Creative-Campaign.jpg" alt="digital marketing examples" width="960" height="600" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Dollar-Shave-Club-Marks-its-Arrival-in-the-UK-with-a-Creative-Campaign.jpg 960w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Dollar-Shave-Club-Marks-its-Arrival-in-the-UK-with-a-Creative-Campaign-300x188.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Dollar-Shave-Club-Marks-its-Arrival-in-the-UK-with-a-Creative-Campaign-768x480.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Dollar-Shave-Club-Marks-its-Arrival-in-the-UK-with-a-Creative-Campaign-700x438.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Image Credit: </strong><a href="http://www.cityam.com/246010/razor-sharp-move-unilever-its-acquisition-dollar-shave-club?utm_source=BuzzInteractive.co&amp;utm_medium=BuzzBlog&amp;utm_campaign=intuit%20brand%20mentions"><strong>CityAm</strong></a></p>
<p>Founded in 2011, Dollar Shave Club was acquired by Unilever in 2016. Lately, the razor subscription brand decided to step into the UK market and to mark its arrival the company used a creative social and experiential campaign.</p>
<p>Not only the Dollar Shave Club launched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wpk_ltU2q3M">a pop-up in Old Street station</a> earlier in January to offer passers-by free shaves, live comedy, and foosball tournaments but also partnered with several social influencers to create hype and relevant content around the launch. This partnership worked for the firm as it made the heads turn.</p>
<p>Sure, we are yet to see if the Dollar Shave Club’s products make a strong impact in the UK market. But, if you compare the hotly anticipated marketing campaign of the brand with the classic US version, you’ll come to know that Dollar Shave Club is surely off to a good start.</p>
<h3><strong>4. ESSC Launches a Thought-Provoking Campaign to Encourage Social Change</strong></h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-18255 size-full" src="https://static.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/4.gif" alt="digital marketing examples" width="656" height="258" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Image Credit: </strong><a href="http://www.easterseals.com/michigan/get-involved/quit-smoking-now.html?utm_source=BuzzInteractive.co&amp;utm_medium=BuzzBlog&amp;utm_campaign=intuit"><strong>ESSC</strong></a></p>
<p>Easterseals Southern California (ESSC) is an organization that assists over 10,000 people with disabilities in different parts of California. The organization has recently launched a new thought-provoking ad campaign that stars its own program recipients. The title of the campaign was “Changing the Way to See Disability,” and its aim was to encourage social change and create inclusion. And to make it work the marketers came up with a really catchy slogan: ‘Celebrate. Don’t Separate.’</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-18256 size-full" src="https://static1.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/5.jpg" alt="digital marketing examples" width="1200" height="600" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/5.jpg 1200w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/5-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/5-768x384.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/5-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/5-1000x500.jpg 1000w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/5-700x350.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Image Credit: </strong><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/celebratedontseparate?utm_source=BuzzInteractive.co&amp;utm_medium=BuzzBlog&amp;utm_campaign=intuit"><strong>#CelebrateDontSeparate</strong></a></p>
<p>According to Mark Whitley, the President, and CEO of ESSC, when people unite as one, they can break down barriers and create social change. He said that each day people make sweeping statements about people with disabilities and a lot of them don’t even realize what they are doing. So to aid people to look beyond what they see at first glance ESSC has launched this movement so we can have a more inclusive world.</p>
<p>The campaign was rolled out through many different channels, including internet, print, and outdoor ads along with “Make the Promise” <a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/social-media-marketing-tips-for-restaurant-business/">social media campaign</a>. The idea behind launching the social media campaign was to ask general people to promote the message of inclusion and use the hashtag #CelebrateDontSeparate.</p>
<p>To create a profound impact, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/EasterSealsSoCal">six California residents were used in the first phase of the campaign</a> along with two ESSC recipients who met through the program and are now engaged. The new campaign has greatly helped ESSC in bringing the social change.</p>
<h3><strong>5. LinkedIn Steps Up to Crush its ‘White Collar’ Typecast with New Campaign</strong></h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-18257 size-full" src="https://static1.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/youtube.jpg" alt="digital marketing Agency" width="1280" height="720" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/youtube.jpg 1280w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/youtube-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/youtube-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/youtube-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/youtube-700x394.jpg 700w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/youtube-539x303.jpg 539w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Image Credit: </strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MsEvg14Y_A&amp;utm_source=BuzzInteractive.co&amp;utm_medium=BuzzBlog&amp;utm_campaign=intuit%20brand%20mentions"><strong>YouTube</strong></a></p>
<p>The popular business social network LinkedIn is looking to squash it&#8217;s ‘white collar’ typecast and to realize its dream the brand has released a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VS4sNlXPsB0">TV spot titled “In it Together”</a> back in January during the 2018 Golden Globe Awards show.</p>
<p>This was something LinkedIn has never done in the past. However, it certainly makes sense since the brand is looking to disentangle itself from its current perception. The influential thing about the “In it Together” campaign was the diverse range of businesses and people that featured in it.</p>
<p>The new campaign was the first real integrated marketing effort by the social network. Apart from the TV spot, the marketing campaign also included a digital display, online video, search engine marketing, paid social media &amp; outdoor ads, partnerships, podcasts, and radio spots. All in all, the campaign lasted for 12 weeks and it targeted four core markets: Los Angeles, San Francisco, Atlanta, and Philadelphia.</p>
<p>The idea was to compare LinkedIn activity in these cities with other parts of the world that haven’t been targeted to comprehend the results of the campaign. The black-and-white, documentary-style video showcased the success stories of LinkedIn users in their own unique environments.</p>
<p>While explaining the impact of the campaign Stacy Peralta, the campaign director, revealed in an email to Adweek that she knew from the beginning that this is one of those rare opportunities. Because LinkedIn wanted her to share real stories about real people and they wanted the candor, energy, and enthusiasm of the people involved.</p>
<p>So her team found and documented unique people who are using the platform. They filmed new musicians, real-life cowboys, chefs, MMA fighters, animators, and physics teachers. All of them were not only using LinkedIn but are keen to share its effect on their careers.</p>
<h3><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, the tried-and-tested elements of advertising remain the same, but the unique thing about all the aforementioned marketing campaigns is the use of elements that produced emotions, encouraged empathy and most of all humanizes the brand. This tells digital marketing service providers to explore various avenues in order to find the best fit for their clients so they can achieve desired results.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Content marketing, one of the components of <a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/"><strong>digital marketing services</strong></a>, is a great driver to boost your website’s rank on search engine result pages (SERPs) and enables your website to appear on the top lists on the search engines. A content may not provide benefit to your business if pertinent keywords are not used, and a SEO strategy is not applied; without these two implications all your time, energy and resources will be a waste.</p>
<p>The two strategies mentioned above only come into effect if you have written quality content that the visitors can rely on and comes in compliance with the questions the users are searching for.</p>
<p>Even the best digital marketing agencies have stated that the content is becoming immensely important tool for online marketing and boosting the website’s rank.</p>
<p>Here we will talk about the ingredients that have been proved to provide a delicious content strategy, boosting your search engine optimization (SEO), traffic/leads, brand image, conversion rate, and brand recognition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>7 Ingredients for a Successful Content Development</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong>1. </strong><strong>Original Content Creates Online Standing </strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whenever you are writing for a blog post or your own personal website, make sure that the content comes solely from you and does not represent someone else’s point of view or being a copy version of the content someone else has published on the internet.</p>
<p>When a content writer presents his/her own reasoning&#8217;s and discussions, visitors appreciate it because they don’t clearly want to see the same content thronged on the internet whenever they make a search. Avoid using other’s content and publishing it as your own because it will not result in high traffic to your site, and will distort the future terms with your customers and potential leads.</p>
<p>Creating original content works as a shelter from search engine’s punishment, such as Google, Yahoo, Bing etc. Are you confused? It is simple, Google strictly punishes websites with duplicate content by penalizing them. Also, an original content is thus indexed by Google and other search engines and given more exposure on the result pages as compared to plagiarized content.</p>
<h3><strong>2. Content Should be Authentic and Reliable</strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As we have mentioned above that the content created should be original but along with that it should also provide accurate information to the visitors and be authentic. Any statistic mentioned should be “real” and not something just made by your imagination because that will have an impact on your reputation and consequently worsen your brand’s image.</p>
<p>Presenting original content with no relevant information will not generate leads to your website and thus not be looked at as a reliable source. Content written by you should be in compliance with the users’ intent as well. When you write a content be sure that it should give answers to what the users might be looking for.</p>
<p>A content that includes admirable information and dependable statistics will help in creating high quality inbound links as other content writers may include your website’s link in their content; boosting your ranking on SERPs.</p>
<h3><strong>3. Give Emphasis to Your Headlines</strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Headlines works as a key driver in generating high traffic to your website as it is the first part that is looked at before the whole content is scrolled and read, therefore make sure you create an appealing headline that actually attracts the users and perceive in their mind that the content available is what they are looking for.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that you must create a content that actually provides the information in accordance with the headline you have created otherwise your image will be damaged and the future contents published by you will not generate traffic as visitors might see your headline merely as a clickbait tactic.</p>
<h3><strong>4. Write Precise and Well-Structured Content</strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Users don’t like to read a wall of text therefore write a content that has proper headings, subheadings, bullets etc. Moreover, paragraphing is important as it keeps the interest of users and allows them to read the whole content that has been posted. It also makes it possible to grab attention of users on the important points you have stated relative to if it was written in a continuous form.</p>
<p>Users surfing on the internet look for content that is precise while containing all relevant information so that they are able to skim through the details and absorb the information quickly. Content writing is not merely about word count, but it is about how well you can write while keeping it brief.</p>
<h3><strong>5. Add Infographics, Videos and Images</strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A content that is well structured, contains relevant information and details and all the statistics stated are accurate, but is this all that is needed to engage the audience? The answer is no, because images, videos and infographics makes the content look more polished and keeps your audience engaged.</p>
<p>Let’s assume that you are writing a content for your product, adding videos for instance, how your product is manufactured, or what is the best way to use it etc. will generate more leads and make your content much more appealing in the eyes of the audience. This may also help in boosting your conversion rate due to visitors having more in-depth knowledge about your product.</p>
<p><strong>Note that: </strong>Images or other visual contents used should add value otherwise it will distort your content’s status.</p>
<h3><strong>6. Regularly Update Your Content</strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Updating your content frequently will not only work as a way to get more leads/traffic but it will also help in maintaining your ranking on search engines because different search engines favor websites that have their contents regularly updated. Furthermore, user engagement will rise because they want new content more frequently, and regular updates will also grab attention of new users improving the website’s traffic and ranking.</p>
<h3><strong>7. Content Should be Applied in Real Life Situation</strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Content should not only add to the users’ knowledge but should also help them to use your content as a way to deal with their problems. Users look for contents that are integrated with real life situations and provides a solution for certain problems.</p>
<p>A great content is thus something that adds value to the users’ life and provides them with an advice and enables them to find the most efficient way in using the material they are looking for. This will keep your audience engaged, increasing the dwell time; amount of time a visitor spends on your website, and improve your SEO.</p>
