								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Content marketing, one of the components of <a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/"><strong>digital marketing services</strong></a>, is a great driver to boost your website’s rank on search engine result pages (SERPs) and enables your website to appear on the top lists on the search engines. A content may not provide benefit to your business if pertinent keywords are not used, and a SEO strategy is not applied; without these two implications all your time, energy and resources will be a waste.</p>
<p>The two strategies mentioned above only come into effect if you have written quality content that the visitors can rely on and comes in compliance with the questions the users are searching for.</p>
<p>Even the best digital marketing agencies have stated that the content is becoming immensely important tool for online marketing and boosting the website’s rank.</p>
<p>Here we will talk about the ingredients that have been proved to provide a delicious content strategy, boosting your search engine optimization (SEO), traffic/leads, brand image, conversion rate, and brand recognition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>7 Ingredients for a Successful Content Development</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong>1. </strong><strong>Original Content Creates Online Standing </strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whenever you are writing for a blog post or your own personal website, make sure that the content comes solely from you and does not represent someone else’s point of view or being a copy version of the content someone else has published on the internet.</p>
<p>When a content writer presents his/her own reasoning&#8217;s and discussions, visitors appreciate it because they don’t clearly want to see the same content thronged on the internet whenever they make a search. Avoid using other’s content and publishing it as your own because it will not result in high traffic to your site, and will distort the future terms with your customers and potential leads.</p>
<p>Creating original content works as a shelter from search engine’s punishment, such as Google, Yahoo, Bing etc. Are you confused? It is simple, Google strictly punishes websites with duplicate content by penalizing them. Also, an original content is thus indexed by Google and other search engines and given more exposure on the result pages as compared to plagiarized content.</p>
<h3><strong>2. Content Should be Authentic and Reliable</strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As we have mentioned above that the content created should be original but along with that it should also provide accurate information to the visitors and be authentic. Any statistic mentioned should be “real” and not something just made by your imagination because that will have an impact on your reputation and consequently worsen your brand’s image.</p>
<p>Presenting original content with no relevant information will not generate leads to your website and thus not be looked at as a reliable source. Content written by you should be in compliance with the users’ intent as well. When you write a content be sure that it should give answers to what the users might be looking for.</p>
<p>A content that includes admirable information and dependable statistics will help in creating high quality inbound links as other content writers may include your website’s link in their content; boosting your ranking on SERPs.</p>
<h3><strong>3. Give Emphasis to Your Headlines</strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Headlines works as a key driver in generating high traffic to your website as it is the first part that is looked at before the whole content is scrolled and read, therefore make sure you create an appealing headline that actually attracts the users and perceive in their mind that the content available is what they are looking for.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that you must create a content that actually provides the information in accordance with the headline you have created otherwise your image will be damaged and the future contents published by you will not generate traffic as visitors might see your headline merely as a clickbait tactic.</p>
<h3><strong>4. Write Precise and Well-Structured Content</strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Users don’t like to read a wall of text therefore write a content that has proper headings, subheadings, bullets etc. Moreover, paragraphing is important as it keeps the interest of users and allows them to read the whole content that has been posted. It also makes it possible to grab attention of users on the important points you have stated relative to if it was written in a continuous form.</p>
<p>Users surfing on the internet look for content that is precise while containing all relevant information so that they are able to skim through the details and absorb the information quickly. Content writing is not merely about word count, but it is about how well you can write while keeping it brief.</p>
<h3><strong>5. Add Infographics, Videos and Images</strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A content that is well structured, contains relevant information and details and all the statistics stated are accurate, but is this all that is needed to engage the audience? The answer is no, because images, videos and infographics makes the content look more polished and keeps your audience engaged.</p>
<p>Let’s assume that you are writing a content for your product, adding videos for instance, how your product is manufactured, or what is the best way to use it etc. will generate more leads and make your content much more appealing in the eyes of the audience. This may also help in boosting your conversion rate due to visitors having more in-depth knowledge about your product.</p>
<p><strong>Note that: </strong>Images or other visual contents used should add value otherwise it will distort your content’s status.</p>
<h3><strong>6. Regularly Update Your Content</strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Updating your content frequently will not only work as a way to get more leads/traffic but it will also help in maintaining your ranking on search engines because different search engines favor websites that have their contents regularly updated. Furthermore, user engagement will rise because they want new content more frequently, and regular updates will also grab attention of new users improving the website’s traffic and ranking.</p>
<h3><strong>7. Content Should be Applied in Real Life Situation</strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Content should not only add to the users’ knowledge but should also help them to use your content as a way to deal with their problems. Users look for contents that are integrated with real life situations and provides a solution for certain problems.</p>
<p>A great content is thus something that adds value to the users’ life and provides them with an advice and enables them to find the most efficient way in using the material they are looking for. This will keep your audience engaged, increasing the dwell time; amount of time a visitor spends on your website, and improve your SEO.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Digital marketing is one of the emerging communication mediums of this era of technology and social media. Nowadays, brands use multiple tactics to win the attention by giving away what matters the most to the audience. The arbitrage of attention and value between the customers and brands is what that is redefining the business development and marketing strategies.</p>
<p>A successful digital marketing campaign refers to the fruitful engagement of the prospective customers on the internet. However, the digital marketing doesn’t always provide outcome on the financial side, but sometimes it’s related to brand positioning and recognition.</p>
<p>Every company’s digital marketing campaign is unique, not to mention their methods are always different. In some cases, it is quite possible that the agency that is designing the whole campaign drives the whole strategy. On the other hand, some brands prefer to define their <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/digital-marketing-tactics-win-brand-war-muhammad-gohar-shafique/">digital marketing strategy</a> based on the consensus between the brand and agency.</p>
<p>Pay close attention if you’re a brand and haven’t had a chance to run a digital marketing campaign either through any <a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/"><strong>digital marketing agency</strong></a> or in-house staff.</p>
<p>Following are the basics of running a successful digital marketing campaign:</p>
<h3>1- Understanding the Brand Identity</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-17069 size-full" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/brand-identity.jpg" alt="brand identity" width="1266" height="500" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/brand-identity.jpg 1266w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/brand-identity-300x118.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/brand-identity-768x303.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/brand-identity-1024x404.jpg 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/brand-identity-700x276.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1266px) 100vw, 1266px" /></p>
<p>It’s true that digital marketing revolves around various forms of communication such as content creation, online advertising, and social media, but to start off on the right foot, a brand must figure out its identity. If a brand doesn’t know about its value proposition, target audience, competitive edge, and competition, then it won’t be able to make an impact. So understanding the brand identity means getting to know the brand inside out. If the team behind a brand knows these elements, they can certainly pull this off the right way. It’s easy to decide whether you should run ads on Facebook or Google or Twitter, but understanding the brand’s identity is somewhat that comes before hopping onto any advertising platform. A successful digital marketing campaign is built on acknowledging the message that the brand has to convey what differentiates them from the competition.</p>
<h3>2- Delivering the Value</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-17070 size-full" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/digital-graph.jpg" alt="value graph" width="1266" height="500" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/digital-graph.jpg 1266w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/digital-graph-300x118.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/digital-graph-768x303.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/digital-graph-1024x404.jpg 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/digital-graph-700x276.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1266px) 100vw, 1266px" /></p>
<p>Digital marketing is a multi-dimensional strategy, and every individual brand chooses a specific area to go all in. Without embracing the brand identity and without being aware of the strengths, it becomes difficult for a brand to put something out for the audience to consume. However, delivering the value is one of the most important aspects of digital marketing. A campaign, for example, a Facebook video ad may not get traction if it doesn’t stand out or not reaching to the right audience. A brand must find out what kind of content such as written, audio, video, or graphical resonates with its audience because that’s the way forward to providing the right type of information the audience is expecting to get. It won’t be unfair to say that any valuable piece of content that provides the value upfront has a better chance to perform well than the clickable banner ad that could lead to somewhere else. Provide value upfront and build your brand’s momentum on top of that rather than being salesy and directly selling the product through online advertising. Have you seen some YouTube pre-roll ads that have a useful message to share and perhaps we watch the ad? So the successful digital marketing campaign must be delivering the value without asking for asking anything in return, at least, for the time being.</p>
<h3>3- Igniting the Engagement</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-17071 size-full" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/engagement-measurement.jpg" alt="engagement measurement" width="1266" height="500" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/engagement-measurement.jpg 1266w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/engagement-measurement-300x118.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/engagement-measurement-768x303.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/engagement-measurement-1024x404.jpg 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/engagement-measurement-700x276.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1266px) 100vw, 1266px" /></p>
<p>A digital marketing campaign can’t be considered a success unless it entices people to respond mostly in a positive manner. People react to the extremely positive, negative, or helpful things they see on the internet. Most of the brands like to touch the helpful or positive section of the chart. So if a campaign whether it’s an ad, article, infographic, video, or an audio creates a buzz around and arouses people to react to it, then it’s serving its purpose.</p>
<h3>4- Solving a Problem</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-17072 size-full" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/problem-solving-idea.jpg" alt="problem solving idea" width="1266" height="500" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/problem-solving-idea.jpg 1266w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/problem-solving-idea-300x118.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/problem-solving-idea-768x303.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/problem-solving-idea-1024x404.jpg 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/problem-solving-idea-700x276.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1266px) 100vw, 1266px" /></p>
<p>Whether you’re doing video marketing, content marketing, infographics, visuals, or podcasting, you can create a robust digital marketing campaign around any medium of content creation you choose. The only thing that matters is becoming the part of the solution. If your talks or written words or images solve any problem of the right audience, you’re all good. A highly cinematic video ad may get attention in the beginning, but if the message is unclear, then the brand won’t reap the benefits later. The reason for this is that the majority of people might get confused with the message or interpret it wrong. So ambiguity leads to low response rate. On the flip side, if the message is clear and resonates with the audience, it could lead to virality. Therefore, to make it  successful, one must clarify the message to ensure that it solves the problem.</p>
<h3>5- Analyzing the Outcome</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-17073 size-full" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/analyzing-outcome.jpg" alt="analyzing outcome" width="1266" height="500" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/analyzing-outcome.jpg 1266w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/analyzing-outcome-300x118.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/analyzing-outcome-768x303.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/analyzing-outcome-1024x404.jpg 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/analyzing-outcome-700x276.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1266px) 100vw, 1266px" /></p>
<p>One of the perks of a successful digital marketing campaign is that you get to see things that worked well for your brand’s marketing. If you’re emphasizing a lot on written content and the certain type of articles are performing better than the others, then you can create relevant content so that it doubles down the impact. There are no specific tools to analyze the outcome. However, a lot of SEO results could be seen through Ahrefs, SEMrush, and Majestic tools. It comes down to every individual brand’s choice. Maybe, a brand is looking at its Google Analytics to gather the traffic data, and the other brand is keen to collect the email subscribers’ data through email marketing software like MailChimp or Aweber, whereas maybe another brand is following the Facebook ad statistics to hone the ad strategy. The critical part is the analysis of the outcome, which may lead to improving the whole campaign.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>A digital marketing campaign comprises of various components. Every brand chooses to focus on the specific type of content to produce, publish, and promote. Once they put it out there, they need to leverage the content by taking it in front of the right kind of eyeballs. To make that happen, either they choose online advertising or search engine optimization or content marketing to win the attention of the prospective clients.</p>
<p>A successful digital marketing campaign, however, doesn’t guarantee the financial transaction, but it instead builds a relationship between the brand and the audience.</p>
