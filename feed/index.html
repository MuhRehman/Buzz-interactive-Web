								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A study done by Moz in 2019 revealed that the majority of local businesses agree that Google is becoming the new “homepage” for businesses.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21966" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/9-1.jpg" alt="Moz Study on Importance of Google and Website for Local Businesses" width="577" height="424" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/9-1.jpg 577w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/9-1-300x220.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 577px) 100vw, 577px" />A point to notice here is that it’s the local businesses that cannot deny the need for a website. Now evaluate your need for a website if your company is a modern-day tech-savvy startup.</p>
<p>Let us share a stat with you as well;</p>
<p>It just takes <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01449290500330448">50 milliseconds</a> (equal to 0.05 seconds) for a user to form an opinion about our business by looking at your website.</p>
<p>Thus you should really assess your approach, your resources, and your taste, twice, when it comes to developing a website for your startup.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Why is a Website Vital for Every Startup?</strong></h2>
<p>Website is one of those basic elements every company should start with when it comes to digitally enhance its look in front of the right audience.</p>
<p>However, this point is often not expounded as it should be and it leads you to see content with headings like; <strong>“Website development is dead”</strong> leaving you in immense confusion.</p>
<p>Today we’ll look into the need and dynamics of a website, for a startup, from a marketer’s eye. This means only practical uses and core requirements of a website will be discussed which directly impacts your startup for real.</p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>By sharing anything regarding web development for startups in this article, we’re especially targeting modern-day tech startups however all of this information pretty much applies to traditional small businesses as well.</p>
<p><strong>1) You don’t own/control these platforms</strong></p>
<p>Once a wise man said; <em>“Freedom has no price!”</em></p>
<p>All the digital platforms where you just sign up build a profile and start getting traffic by being active operate on their own terms.</p>
<p>There’s always some risk (if not a lot) of getting banned/penalized with just one malpractice of yours (or not even that in some cases) and you wouldn’t be in control to do anything as a response other than emailing their team.</p>
<p><strong>2) Pay or you won’t get any reach on social</strong></p>
<p>According to a study done by Jay Baer in 2014, as Facebook’s organic reach went down their stock prices went up.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-21971" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/8-1.jpg" alt="Facebook organic reach decline" width="593" height="417" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/8-1.jpg 820w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/8-1-300x211.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/8-1-768x540.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/8-1-700x493.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 593px) 100vw, 593px" />Your own website, on the other hand, can work independently without any reach decline risks.</p>
<p><strong>3) Social profile won’t display your unique brand image</strong></p>
<p>It’s as basic as it sounds. A Facebook/Instagram page or any social account for your business isn’t portraying your brand’s unique image contextually.</p>
<p>A brand image is far more than just making a grid on Instagram or posting pictures that align with your logo colors.  It means to;</p>
<ul>
<li>Control your brand narrative in front of your audience</li>
<li>Send your audience away (to social pages for example) when you want to</li>
<li>Customize the design/theme to resonate with your brand position</li>
</ul>
<p>If you pay attention, all of these requirements can only be fulfilled by…you guessed it right, a website.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Evaluating the Plan for Your Startup Website</strong></h2>
<p>Planning any website’s architecture, design, layout or anything of that nature purely depends on the need of the organization.</p>
<p>An NGOs website design would be entirely different than a startup’s design. This is web design 101 stuff. The question is how do you evaluate your startup’s plan in terms of the website?</p>
<p>Here’s the answer;</p>
<h3><strong>1) Assess your startup, &amp; define goals</strong></h3>
<p>Start by looking at the core of your business. Simply answering the following questions will help you move one step closer;</p>
<ul>
<li>What is my startup all about?</li>
<li>What is the way I want people to perceive my startup’s brand?</li>
<li>What is that I am trying to accomplish with my startup?</li>
</ul>
<p>As an example of this, let’s consider; <strong>SpaceX </strong>and<strong> Adobe. </strong>Both are very different companies with very different brands and it clearly reflects in their website’s design.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-21952" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/7.jpg" alt="How branding affects website design" width="777" height="408" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/7.jpg 1266w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/7-300x157.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/7-768x403.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/7-1024x537.jpg 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/7-700x367.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px" />That’s how a brand’s image is identified and portrayed in your web design sturdily.</p>
<p>Note: This is a phase you can only get done with, through brainstorming and ideation.</p>
<h3><strong>2) Judge your targeted audience</strong></h3>
<p>Next is judging your targeted audience. Knowing the people you’re targeting can be helpful to think of the way your website needs to be structured/designed/developed since those are the folks you’d be solving problems for.</p>
<p>But how does a startup know what its target audience wants if not even the first version of your website has been put forward? Or if you don’t have a targeted audience in the first place</p>
<p>There are various tools you can use for those purposes. <strong>SparkToro</strong> is one of the best out of all those.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-21953" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/6.jpg" alt="Sparktoro Homepage: Audience Intelligence tool" width="788" height="453" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/6.jpg 1266w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/6-300x172.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/6-768x441.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/6-1024x588.jpg 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/6-345x198.jpg 345w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/6-700x402.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 788px) 100vw, 788px" />All you have to do is give some keywords that resonate with your audience and it’ll pull the kind of content (articles/podcasts/videos) your audience consumes.</p>
<p>It will help you evaluate what would be your brand’s ideal positioning as per your consumer&#8217;s choice of content to plan your website branding.</p>
<h3><strong>3) Study your competitor’s approach </strong></h3>
<p>Studying your competitors can give you key insights into how your brand and onwards your website’s design/structure should look from a marketing perspective (we’ll jump deeper into the structural analysis in a few minutes).</p>
<p>Keyword research is a great way to identify the problems your audience is searching for the solution for.</p>
<p>And of course, your website should be structured in a way that those problems are solved on the page in the first look or the users are directed towards the solution properly.</p>
<p>You can either do all this research part manually by looking at your competitor’s website and content.</p>
<p>Or you can use a tool like <a href="https://try.alexa.com/target-audience-analysis">Alexa Audience Interest</a> which does it all for you.</p>
<p><strong><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-21954" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/4.jpg" alt="alexa audience interest tool" width="803" height="505" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/4.jpg 1266w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/4-300x189.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/4-768x483.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/4-1024x645.jpg 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/4-700x441.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 803px) 100vw, 803px" /></strong></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Planning the Website Development for Your Startup</strong></h2>
<p>It’s the easiest to keep your website’s structure/architecture when you’re just starting out.</p>
<p>So it’s important that you get every technical aspect covered and not overwhelmed by elements that are not so crucial (right now) either.</p>
<h3><strong>4) Think of Design &amp; Structural Ideas                 </strong></h3>
<p>You’d need to develop landing pages targeting specific keywords and set of audiences for various services. These landing pages will serve two purposes;</p>
<ul>
<li>Specifies each of your services on each page</li>
<li>Helps you market each service via paid ads or SEO later.</li>
</ul>
<p>A practical (and much efficient) way of analyzing your competitor’s website architecture is using a tool like ScreamingFrog. Just putting in the domain of your competitor you assess their website’s structure in one look as it appears in a simple tree diagram;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-21955" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/5.jpg" alt="Screaming Frog Website Tree" width="797" height="750" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/5.jpg 1069w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/5-300x282.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/5-768x722.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/5-1024x963.jpg 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/5-700x658.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 797px) 100vw, 797px" />This would help you decide;</p>
<ul>
<li>How many pages you need</li>
<li>What should the hierarchy look like</li>
<li>What pages to prioritize over others etc.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>5) Define your specific requirements</strong></h3>
<p>You have to know your product in and out. That’ll help you know what exact elements you need in your website.</p>
<p>Think, and understand from a consumer’s perspective, what would be needed on the homepage, if you’re looking for the solution of a problem that your product/startup solves?</p>
<p>For example, think of <a href="https://www.canva.com/" class="broken_link">Canva</a>. The product brings you a variety of creative design templates and if you were looking for those, their homepage would have directed you to your solution (their designs builder) in <strong>just three steps</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-21956" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/3.jpg" alt="Canva Homepage three step navigation" width="790" height="473" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/3.jpg 1266w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/3-300x180.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/3-768x460.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/3-1024x613.jpg 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/3-700x419.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 790px) 100vw, 790px" />Canva</strong> realized that all its user needs on the homepage is;</p>
<ul>
<li>Simple navigation displayed prominently</li>
<li>A search bar for user to search any design template</li>
<li>A section where the user can pick the design they want</li>
</ul>
<p>Another example to understand the concept better is that if you own a consulting and advisory firm.</p>
<p>What you are offering is a consulting call/meeting to businesses so that should be the most prominent element on the homepage as a call to action (and of course some good copy above that).</p>
<p>Advanced Process Optimization, a business consulting firm, does a good job of a CTA (call-to-action) regarding this;</p>
<h3><strong><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-21957" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2.jpg" alt="Homepage CTA for a consulting firm" width="790" height="500" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2.jpg 1266w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2-300x190.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2-768x486.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2-1024x648.jpg 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2-700x443.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 790px) 100vw, 790px" />6) Document all the information/ideas together </strong></h3>
<p>Being a tech startup owner doesn’t require you to be so tech-savvy that you build wireframes or design UI/UX for your website however you have to keep all your requirements document.</p>
<p>It doesn’t have to be highly technical. Just put out a piece of paper or use digital tools available; write your requirements with the website and draw a rough design.</p>
<p>You have to put two things in line with this process;</p>
<ul>
<li>An in-depth sitemap of all pages</li>
<li>The flow of the pages</li>
<li>Key elements you need (on some crucial pages at least)</li>
</ul>
<p>Till now you must have a clear vision for yourself; what you want, how it should be done etc. Let’s now assess the cost.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Cost Estimation for a Startup’s Website Development </strong></h2>
<p><strong>Short answer: </strong></p>
<p>Cleveroad did a massive breakdown of how much does it cost to build a website and according to their analysis the average costs range anywhere from<strong> $8,750</strong> to <strong>$38,000</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Long Answer: </strong></p>
<p>The answer to this question is pretty much variable and depends on the skillset of the resource being hired, the phases of development a website goes through, and the type of website that</p>
<p>Let’s dive deeper into the elements</p>
<h3><strong>Website development cost (by types)</strong></h3>
<p>The type of website being developed also impacts the overall cost. I.e. is it just a landing page, an eCommerce website, or a business website.</p>
<p>However, if we look at what the range of hourly rates looks like for each, we can get a value.</p>

<p><strong>Note: </strong>None of these numbers are 100% certain. They can go up or down depending on your exact requirement and the resource you hire; freelance, in-house, or agency.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Choosing a Resource for Your Startup’s Website Development</strong></h2>
<p>The resources generally available for website development service are either of the following;</p>
<ul>
<li>Freelancers</li>
<li>In-House</li>
<li>Agencies</li>
</ul>
<p>Startups initiate at different levels of funding and thus possess different levels of resources. You can go with either a freelancer, hire an in-house resource, or go with a digital agency.</p>
<p>All these resources have various merits and demerits to hire for the website of your startup. Here’s a quick overview of each resource;</p>
<h2><strong><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21968" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/11-1.jpg" alt="Freelancer VS In-house VS Agency" width="1266" height="672" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/11-1.jpg 1266w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/11-1-300x159.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/11-1-768x408.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/11-1-1024x544.jpg 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/11-1-700x372.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1266px) 100vw, 1266px" />Final Takeaway </strong></h2>
<p>Finally, there comes an additional factor of <strong>personal preference</strong> that would impact your choice of resource, your budget, and your website requirements.</p>
<p>However, in an ideal scenario, agencies/consultants have seen to outperform building a complete in house team for specified roles.</p>
<p>As a <a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/">digital marketing agency</a> ourselves it may seem like our approach is biased in this article however many marketing leaders, like Rand Fishkin (Founder of <a href="https://moz.com/">Moz</a> &amp; <a href="https://sparktoro.com/">SparkToro</a>), have in fact come to realize that going with agencies/consultants is a better option for almost every scenario.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Website development and design practices have gone through a lot of changes in the way we see them today. Nowadays, developing a website is also a matter of being creative and trendy than just having the technical knowledge.</p>



<p>According to Netcraft’s web server survey in January 2019, there are over 1 billion websites on the World Wide Web. And this whopping number of websites is increasing every second.</p>



<p>This literally means that there is 1 website for every 7 people on the planet. And that’s already a lot of websites.</p>



<p>For this reason, there is growing need for applying different tactics and techniques so that your website can stand out among so many others. Today, businesses and individual website owners have to go a step further in making their websites more advanced and personalized to the audience they are trying to attract.</p>



<p>So talking about the upcoming future trends in web design and development industry in 2020, web developers are required to keep up with a myriad of technological as well as design related trends.</p>



<h1><strong>Progressive Web Apps</strong></h1>



<p>Progressive Web Applications or PWAs are increasingly becoming popular among web developers and users.</p>



<p>A Progressive Web App or PWA is an application software. Or you can simply put that a PWA is a website that gives the look and feel of a native mobile app.Popular examples of progressive web apps are: Uber, Pinterest, MakeMyTrip, Twitter Lite and others.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img class="wp-image-19892" src="https://static1.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/uber.jpg" alt="" width="565" height="376" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/uber.jpg 700w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/uber-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 565px) 100vw, 565px" />

</div>



<p style="text-align: center;"> </p>



<p>Plus, you don’t necessarily have to download a PWA in your mobile phone &#8211; while you enjoy the ease of programming of a website. In PWAs, you get to access all the information and modern capabilities as you do in a mobile app.</p>



<p>Moreover, the modern features of PWAs are supported by majority of the web browsers. Meaning that every business can start to launch a website that’s smooth, swift, and app-like in its feel.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img class="wp-image-19893" src="https://static.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/starbucks-1024x1024.jpg" alt="" width="446" height="446" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/starbucks-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/starbucks-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/starbucks-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/starbucks-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/starbucks-570x570.jpg 570w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/starbucks-500x500.jpg 500w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/starbucks-1000x1000.jpg 1000w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/starbucks-700x700.jpg 700w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/starbucks.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 446px) 100vw, 446px" />

<p style="text-align: center;"> </p>



<p>For these reasons, <a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/web-development-services/">PWA web development</a> is going to remain a popular choice in 2020 and beyond.</p>



<p>It’s important to state here that most of the well-known companies have experienced a significant growth in their user engagement. And increase in user engagement gave them high conversion rates upon using PWAs.</p>



<p>Take the example of <strong>Twitter Lite</strong> as a good case in point. Twitter had realized that they needed an app that worked on every device, and loaded quickly. As it had to engage a whopping 380 million audience at that time, Twitter introduced its PWA version in the form of Twitter Lite.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img class="wp-image-19930" src="https://static2.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/twitter-mobile.jpg" alt="Twitter mobile" width="566" height="377" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/twitter-mobile.jpg 623w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/twitter-mobile-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 566px) 100vw, 566px" />

</figure>
</div>



<p style="text-align: center;"> </p>



<p>The results achieved were incredible! Twitter experienced:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>★ 65% increase in pages per session</p>
<p>★ 75% increase in Tweets sent</p>
<p>★ And a 20% decrease in bounce rates</p>
</blockquote>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<h3> </h3>



<h3><strong>Benefits</strong></h3>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>➝ <strong>App-like experience:</strong> Makes easy for your users to access your content &#8211; so they keep coming back.</p>
<p>➝ <strong>Faster loading time:</strong> Decreases the bounce rate (users clicking away from website after viewing only one page).</p>
<p>➝ <strong>Better UX:</strong> Engages users, which allows them to stay on your website for long.</p>
<p>➝ <strong>Lesser consumption:</strong> Internet data is consumed less.</p>
<p>➝ <strong>Increased Sales:</strong> Happy and engaged users increase conversion rates.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>UX Design</strong></h3>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Talking about a <a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/design-services/">UX design website</a>, there is cut-throat competition among websites in the online world. User experience or UX refers to the overall experience of a user looking at your website in terms of how easy and pleasing it is to use.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-19895" src="https://static3.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ux-design.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ux-design.jpg 600w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ux-design-300x150.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" />

</div>



<p style="text-align: center;"> </p>



<p>But why are UX design best practices becoming so much of a grave concern for almost every website owner?</p>



<p>It’s because users these days are super impatient in their online behaviour. A user today, according to <a href="https://allisonjedwards.com/the-attention-span-crisis-and-what-it-means-for-kids/" rel="nofollow">research</a>, can focus on a web page for just 8 seconds. This raises the chance of more users clicking away if you are not optimizing your UX design.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img class="wp-image-19896" src="https://static2.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/human.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="469" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/human.jpg 712w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/human-300x281.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/human-700x657.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></figure>
</div>



<p>So the more your website page visuals and style click the minds of the users, the more they enjoy checking it out.</p>



<p>A lot more focus will be on making the UX design more relevant to the taste of target audience in 2020. So that it reduces friction, and saves time of users.</p>



<p>Some important UX design best practices you should consider include:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>★ Personalize website according to your target audience.</p>
<p>★ Light popups suggesting tips to users to speed up their action taking.</p>
<p>★ Features should be visible only when a user needs to see them in a specific context.</p>
<p>★ Simple changes like placement of navigation bar, non-irritating presentation of adverts, and avoidance of distracting popups can work wonders.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Benefits</strong></h3>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>➝ <strong>Increase in Revenue:</strong>  75% of people think of a website based on its overall aesthetics. Organically increasing the engagement of users through awesome UX design is a good way of ensuring long-term increase in sales. Rather than depending on just advertising for boosting short term sales.</p>
<p>➝ <strong>Low Costs:</strong> Applying UX design approach in website development cuts a lot of costs.</p>
<p>➝ <strong>UX Design Increases Customer Loyalty:</strong> Positively engaging experiences bind users to your product. This keeps them coming back for more.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Chatbots</strong></h2>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Chatbots are empowered through Artificial Intelligence (AI). They simply help users to share their queries which they otherwise would enquire from a human customer service representative.</p>



<p>While the owner is away taking care of other things, AI helps bots solve problems and interact in a human like style with customers.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img class="wp-image-19898" src="https://static2.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/chatbox.png" alt="" width="463" height="400" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/chatbox.png 832w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/chatbox-300x260.png 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/chatbox-768x665.png 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/chatbox-700x606.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 463px) 100vw, 463px" /></figure>
</div>



<p>Due to its popularity and acceptance among internet users, more and more companies are opting for interactive chatbots on their websites. This demand for AI powered technology performing multitasking will see a rapid increase throughout 2020.</p>



<p>Furthermore, big companies are making financial investments to enable AI bots with complex thinking and negotiation capacity like that of humans. These AI chatbots now seem to take over the messaging industry with their multipurpose role capabilities.</p>

<p>“Google analysts also believe that next year, 2020, robots will be smart enough so that mimic complex behavior of humans like flirting and jokes”</p>

<h3><strong>Benefits</strong></h3>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>➝ <strong>Accessible anytime: </strong>People spend around 7 minutes until they are assigned to a CSR. Chatbots are replacing slower communication methods like emails, phone calls and live chat.</p>
<p>➝ <strong>Handling capacity:</strong> can communicate with thousands of humans at the same time.</p>
<p>➝ <strong>Satisfied Customers:</strong> Chatbots are not prone to emotions like human beings. They follow only what they are programmed to do. Bots also retain the user’s order history like address, name, number and other preferences &#8211; making transactions very simple and fast.</p>
<p>➝ <strong>Cost effectivity:</strong> You don’t have to pay a salary to a chatbot.</p>
<p>➝ <strong>Customer Data Recording:</strong> Bots are able to record consumer behaviour and their purchasing patterns. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ajagrawal/2016/07/13/7-ways-chatbot-tools-are-important-for-marketing/#3c4b4230602e">Forbes</a> says that this capacity helps any company to decide “which products to market differently, which to market more and which to redevelop for relaunch”. In this way, more personalized services to the consumer are achieved.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Minimalist Approach to Web Design</strong></h3>



<p>Another growing trend in web development is the need to prefer simplicity over visual splendour.</p>



<p>Neatly designed websites tend to gather more user appeal. So the practice of complimenting high quality visuals with minimalism and clean-design solutions is a great way of growing user appeal. It’s better if you hire a professional <a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/web-development-services/">web design and development company</a> that fully caters to all your business’s requisite needs.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img class="wp-image-19900" src="https://static.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/nerds-1024x497.jpg" alt="" width="549" height="266" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/nerds-1024x497.jpg 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/nerds-300x146.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/nerds-768x373.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/nerds-700x340.jpg 700w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/nerds.jpg 1347w" sizes="(max-width: 549px) 100vw, 549px" />

</div>



<p>Further focus is on writing personalized and simple worded content that engages users into exploring more about your brand.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img class="wp-image-19914" src="https://static3.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/the-law-practice.png" alt="new law practice" width="616" height="276" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/the-law-practice.png 697w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/the-law-practice-300x135.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 616px) 100vw, 616px" /></figure>
</div>



<p>This practice was started by the Microsoft Corporation in its OS development preferences. Where Microsoft began creating easy to navigate UIs (user interface) and proper placement of touchscreen ready elements.</p>



<h3><strong>Benefits</strong></h3>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>➝ <strong>Ranking &amp; Traffic:</strong> Google and other search engines rank your website to a higher position. And with better ranking and a neat website, you will get more and more traffic and leads.</p>
<p>➝ <strong>Loading Span: </strong>Web page loading speed is accelerated.</p>

<p>➝ <strong>User engagement:</strong> Better accessibility will let more users to be engaged on your website. Web</p>
</blockquote>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Single Page Applications</strong></h3>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p>A Single Page Application is a website that fits on a single page. The main goal of sticking to a single page style is to make the user experience effortlessly smooth.</p>



<p>Having said that, the old way of surfing a website’s pages is slow. It’s that whenever you want to go to a certain web page on the browser, each page takes time to separately load and then shows up.</p>



<p>Conversely, what SPAs do is that they instantly download all the web pages at the backend in the form of a file. In this way, SPAs save you from reloading any pages. As a result, scrolling through many pages becomes a matter of seconds for users.</p>



<p>The inconvenience of long page loading time is now being replaced by a growing trend in the development of SPAs in web development.</p>



<p>Because they are fast and easy to navigate, more companies are joining the race to create better SPA style websites for their users.</p>



<p>And so the SPAs here to stay in 2020 and beyond.</p>



<p>Remarkable examples of popular SPAs include:</p>

<h3><strong>AI Content Curation</strong></h3>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p>The true merit of a website is measured by its content. This fact cannot be emphasized enough.</p>



<p>Content is simply “the king” in user engagement.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img class="wp-image-19905" src="https://static.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/triberr-1024x575.jpg" alt="" width="563" height="315" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/triberr-1024x575.jpg 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/triberr-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/triberr-700x393.jpg 700w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/triberr-539x303.jpg 539w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/triberr.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 563px) 100vw, 563px" />

<p style="text-align: center;"> </p>



<p>Artificial Intelligence based content curation rules the roost in the upcoming future. AI algorithms will soon take over the process of content curation just as AI chatbots look after human queries.</p>



<p>So how will this happen?</p>



<p>An example can that be of a professional painter. While surfing the web, a painter won’t necessarily be interested in a lifestyle blog or an SEO blog, right? In such situations, AI will automatically be triggered to place painting related content on the forefront.</p>



<p>Websites will thus be developed and optimized in such a way in 2020 and beyond for more intelligent responses.</p>



<p>Moreover, users can also opt-out of these settings to have a more hands-on approach for filtering their content.</p>



<h3><strong>Benefits</strong></h3>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>➝ Automatic content selection and generation meaning better matched content for user.</p>
<p>➝ Easier time for users in finding relevant content..</p>
<p>➝ Personalized content for chatbots.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Motion UI</strong></h3>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p>If they say a picture is worth a thousand words. Then how would it be like if a picture moved and transitioned too? Motion UI technology allows you to do just that!</p>



<p>In simple words, a motion UI is a combination of transitioning pieces of animation to make things appear on a website as if they are moving. Developers are now focusing on motion UI for developing websites to make them look more appealing to the users.</p>



<p>Motion UI will soon be a high in demand web development trend because of its:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>★ High potential of usability</p>
<p>★ Modern animations</p>
<p>★ Dynamic visual graphics</p>
<p>★ The storytelling style of presentation</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It allows developers to use a wide range of tools and techniques. So that they can better engage target audience’s attention. Research claims that the average time span of human attention is even less than that of a goldfish.</p>



<p>That being said, today’s users have gotten super bored with hundreds and thousands of similar looking websites on the internet. Old static designs don’t visually appeal to their senses as much as they did in the year 2000 since attention spans are suffering.</p>



<p>That is where motion web UI comes into play. Motion UI’s captivating visuals are an awesome way of getting users to not get bored and pay attention.</p>



<p>Now if you’re successful in getting the user’s attention through motion UI, you can further engage them with your content. So you can turn these engaged users into qualified quality leads for your business.</p>



<h3><strong>Benefits</strong></h3>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>➝ <strong>Low Cost:</strong> It’s created by relatively small sized teams and its development is not costly.</p>
<p>➝ <strong>Always Fresh:</strong> Your site will never look old as designs get easily updated.</p>
<p>➝ <strong>Memorable:</strong> Beautifully captivating click the minds of your target audience so much that they tend to remember your website when they leave.</p>
<p>➝ <strong>More Leads:</strong> Memorable and engaging websites make users to make a purchase decision today or tomorrow as they remember your website.</p>
<p>➝ <strong>Lively Impression:</strong> A huge variety of innovative tactics can be applied that engage you more users.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Internet Of Things</strong></h3>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p>The term IoT or Internet of Things refers to all the electronic devices as a whole that can connect to the internet. Meaning any device that is connectable to the internet will fall in the IoT category.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image">

<p style="text-align: center;"> </p>



<p>IoT has applications in health care, smart cities, agriculture, wearable’s, smart home appliances with many other possibilities.</p>



<p>Now you must be wondering what IoT has to do with website development? Let me explain:</p>



<p>A lot of Internet of Things devices can display website content on them. Popular examples include smart appliances, UI on TVs, laptops, industrial monitors, smart speakers, smart phones, smart watches and glasses, and so forth.</p>



<p>Moreover, the devices in IoT are connected to one another via the internet, and work with huge amounts of data. IoT web development is therefore different from ordinary web development as it puts more focus on system’s scalability and reliability.</p>



<p>More and more new and diverse devices with web display capability are being developed. Therefore IoT will undeniably be an essential part of web development in 2020 and beyond.</p>

<h3><strong>1. User-Centered Design </strong></h3>

<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-21301 size-full" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/user-in-min.jpg.png" alt="User Centered Ecommerce Website Design" width="1365" height="560" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/user-in-min.jpg.png 1365w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/user-in-min.jpg-300x123.png 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/user-in-min.jpg-768x315.png 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/user-in-min.jpg-1024x420.png 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/user-in-min.jpg-700x287.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1365px) 100vw, 1365px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The most essential thing when designing an eCommerce website that boosts your sales is keeping your user in mind. Better representation and good user experience is a success for any eCommerce website.</p>
<p>Your design has a lot to do with your customer conversion rate. For instance, your website could easily turn any visitor to a buyer when it includes every necessary minor detail required for a user. Keep yourself in the shoes of your audience and test any ecommerce website so that you get a clear vision of what a visitor sees at first when buying any stuff online. Likewise, your website could also get examined by anyone on the grounds of appearance, usability, and user satisfaction.</p>
<p>Before moving forward, assess yourself by answering these.</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Do you know what are you selling? </em></li>
<li><em>Do you really know who are you selling to? </em></li>
</ol>
<div class="vc_empty_space"  style="height: 22px" ><span
			class="vc_empty_space_inner">
			<span class="empty_space_image"  ></span>
		</span></div>
<p>When you are certain about these questions, it makes it easy for you to get designed a website that matches your product.</p>
<h3><strong>2. Effective Product Showcase </strong></h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21302" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/products-1.jpg" alt="Effective product showcase in ecommerce website design" width="1365" height="560" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/products-1.jpg 1365w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/products-1-300x123.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/products-1-768x315.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/products-1-1024x420.jpg 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/products-1-700x287.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1365px) 100vw, 1365px" />Online shopping is growing impressively and it doesn’t appear to slow down at any point shortly.</p>
<p>“In 2018, an estimated <strong>1.8 billion people</strong> worldwide purchased goods online (Statista, 2018)”</p>
<p>People love to shop online and the reason may vary from convenience to easy price comparisons. Being an online seller, what you need to make sure is that online shopping experience matches perfectly with in-person experience of shopping.</p>
<p>Your shoppers can not touch or feel your product online but there are ways to let them feel the quality of it by properly and effectively showcasing your product that leaves an awful impression on them.</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Give attention to every detail. </em></li>
<li><em>Do better photography. </em></li>
<li><em>Always show what the latest is.</em></li>
</ol>
<div class="vc_empty_space"  style="height: 22px" ><span
			class="vc_empty_space_inner">
			<span class="empty_space_image"  ></span>
		</span></div>
<p>Choosing a design that highlights the product well is very crucial. If you miss a product image or description, you are persuading the visitors to get off the website. Write product descriptions that offer complete information and answer the following questions:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Who is this product for?</em></li>
<li><em>How does this product work? </em></li>
<li><em>What is this product used for? </em></li>
<li><em>Why is it different? </em></li>
<li><em>Why should anyone buy it? </em></li>
</ol>
<div class="vc_empty_space"  style="height: 22px" ><span
			class="vc_empty_space_inner">
			<span class="empty_space_image"  ></span>
		</span></div>
<p>The features and benefits of the product should be evident. You need to tell them how the features are useful to them and what benefits they are going to get from them.</p>
<p>According to research, the content that has relevant visuals receive 94% more views than the content that does not include visuals. When it comes to an ecommerce website, your product image communicates to your visitors more than the description.</p>
<p>Follow these tips for your product images that can boost sales and conversions:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Use high-resolution images </em></li>
<li><em>Click multiple images from different angles </em></li>
<li><em>Images that can be zoomed in or out </em></li>
<li><em>Big and clear product images</em></li>
</ol>
<div class="vc_empty_space"  style="height: 22px" ><span
			class="vc_empty_space_inner">
			<span class="empty_space_image"  ></span>
		</span></div>
<p>Since we’re moving forward, so people believe that the latest is always better than the past and the cutting edge items are better in quality and that’s how it becomes one of the ways to capture the attention of your shoppers.</p>
<h3><strong>3. Mobile-Responsive Design </strong></h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-21176 size-full" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1-1.jpg" alt="Mobile-Responsive Design of an eCommerce website" width="1365" height="445" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1-1.jpg 1365w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1-1-300x98.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1-1-768x250.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1-1-1024x334.jpg 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1-1-700x228.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1365px) 100vw, 1365px" /></p>
<p>Research from Google shows that 73% of shoppers will move from an inadequately structured mobile website to one that makes buying simpler. Mobile responsive design is a must-have for ecommerce businesses since the number of mobile users is increasing rapidly.</p>
<p>Higher readability and ease of use is going to benefit your website a lot. Make sure that the mobile experience for your user is up to the mark. You can do this by asking your family or friends to test the responsiveness when they purchase from their mobile phones.</p>
<p>If you want to boost your sales and become a top-ranking ecommerce website, make improvements on your mobile design because the search engines such as Google, Bing, and Yahoo prefer the websites that have a responsive mobile design and put their user experience above all.</p>
<h3><strong>4. Show Site Security </strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><img class="aligncenter wp-image-21271 size-full" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/3.jpg" alt="An eCommerce website showing site security in its design" width="803" height="371" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/3.jpg 803w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/3-300x139.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/3-768x355.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/3-800x371.jpg 800w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/3-700x323.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 803px) 100vw, 803px" />Source:</strong> Sandbox</p>
<p>If you own a physical store, you ensure to hire security guards and put your resources into cameras or alarms to guarantee that you are providing your customers an environment where they can shop safely. In the same way, you should be careful about the security of your ecommerce website as well.</p>
<p>In the past 10 years, many cyber-attacks have occurred. The contact and credit card information of more than 110 million of the customers was compromised in 2013 of retail giant Target. In another incident, it was reported that the encrypted passwords or IDs of 38 million users of Adobe were accessed by the attackers. Data breaches are responsible for creating a negative effect on the reputation of any brand.</p>
<p>Do you now see the importance of securing your ecommerce website? No one will ever shop from your website if it seems to be untrustworthy.</p>
<p>You need to make all the essential modifications and adopt a strong strategy on your site for its security. The checkout page should have a lock icon in the address bar or at the bottom of the page. This is an indication that the page contains sensitive information and is secured.</p>
<p>What else can you do to prove that your site is secure and safe?</p>
<p>Make sure to display the security badges that your website has. But you do not have to be fraudulent just to gain the trust of your customers. Only use those badges that you have, otherwise, you may get involved in a legal issue in case of misleading your visitors.</p>
<h3><strong>5. Contact Information </strong></h3>
<p>If your customer has something to ask or is getting confused while making a purchase, he is probably going to go to the contact us page. And this is the part where you can make your customer service process very smooth.</p>
<p>Your contact information should be easy to find for a customer. Do not ever forget to put your email address or phone numbers on your homepage if you do not want to lose a customer. You can add plenty of options to help customers contact you without any hindrance:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Email address </em></li>
<li><em>Phone numbers </em></li>
<li><em>Contact form </em></li>
<li><em>Widget to send a direct message to your Facebook page</em></li>
<li><em>Live chat feature </em></li>
</ol>
<div class="vc_empty_space"  style="height: 22px" ><span
			class="vc_empty_space_inner">
			<span class="empty_space_image"  ></span>
		</span></div>
<p>When you provide complete customer support and contact information, you indirectly get these key advantages:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Increased sales</em></li>
<li><em>Efficient and fast communication </em></li>
</ol>
<div class="vc_empty_space"  style="height: 22px" ><span
			class="vc_empty_space_inner">
			<span class="empty_space_image"  ></span>
		</span></div>
<h3><strong>6. Easy Checkout </strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><img class="aligncenter wp-image-21274 size-full" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2.jpg" alt="Easy Checkout example in an eCommerce website design" width="803" height="371" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2.jpg 803w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2-300x139.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2-768x355.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2-800x371.jpg 800w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2-700x323.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 803px) 100vw, 803px" />Source:</strong> Skullcandy</p>
<p>The checkout page is considered to be the most important page of any ecommerce website. It needs to be given proper attention by the designers.</p>
<p>Imagine a scenario where your customer is proceeding to a checkout page after adding a few items into the cart and has got perplexed by a lengthy form to be filled. You certainly do not want to make the same mistake. Do you?</p>
<p>This page converts your visitor to a customer only if the design provides a smooth transition for everyone. If you have not convinced your buyer then he would probably leave your site having a complicated checkout method. This is the reason 7 out of 10 carts get abandoned. There are specific elements of the simplicity of checkout page, now let’s take note of these:</p>
<p><strong><em>Minimal form design:</em></strong> Keep the design of the minimal and do not annoy your customers by asking too much information that never seems to end.</p>
<p><strong><em>Step by step process:</em></strong> You need to direct your customers through every stage such as personal information, billing, and shipping details.</p>
<p><strong><em>Customizing orders:</em></strong> Allow your customers to update or customize their orders if they want to make any changes to their shopping cart after they have visited the checkout page.</p>
<p><strong><em>Account registration</em></strong>: You do not have to force the users to create an account before completing their checkout process. It can be irritating for a very first time visitor.</p>
<p>Moreover, to cater to a wide range of shoppers you have to provide numerous payment options. Payment solutions should not be restricted. This can give a boost to sales and conversion rates.</p>
<h3><strong>7. Reviews or Testimonials </strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><img class="aligncenter wp-image-21273 size-full" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1.jpg" alt="Reviews and Testimonials in an eCommerce website design" width="803" height="371" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1.jpg 803w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1-300x139.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1-768x355.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1-800x371.jpg 800w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1-700x323.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 803px) 100vw, 803px" />Source:</strong> Trustpilot</p>
<p>There is a survey by iPerceptions showing that customers are 63% more likely to purchase from a website that has their customer reviews.</p>
<p>You can go for testimonials or reviews, it depends on your website structure or choice.</p>
<p>It is not enough to sell a product backed by your words only. Every ecommerce site should clearly show their product reviews to provide a better shopping experience for their potential customers. Furthermore, replying to your customer reviews also gives a good impression on your visitors as it shows that you care about what they say.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to front end development, it is near impossible to work on a site that does not run without using JavaScript.

<h3><strong>2- CSS</strong></h3>
<div class="vc_empty_space"  style="height: 22px" ><span
			class="vc_empty_space_inner">
			<span class="empty_space_image"  ></span>
		</span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another popular programming language and staple addition to the front development of your website is CSS. Short for Cascading Style Sheets, when programmed into the running of your site, CSS can describe how the HTML elements on the site are displayed and presented onto the screen. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Controlling and presenting the page as intended by the developer the inclusion of CSS can save and reduce the amount of work. This can be done by controlling the layout of multiple web pages all at one time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Super simple not just to add, but also to code, without this addition you will be unable to personalize and style web pages. CSS can alter the appearance of colors, spacing, and fonts to the appearance of a web page. Embed images and video, as well as other media, and the addition of headlines and paragraphs. Without CSS the aesthetic choices on hand to personalize your website would be limited. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To implement CSS to the front end of your site, you are fortunate and require little more than a text editor. With many different sites available and programs to help you write this language, finding software for you should be a piece of cake. </span></p>

<h3><strong>3- HTML</strong></h3>

			<span class="empty_space_image"  ></span>
		</span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A standard feature at the front end of a website, when it comes to the best front end development language, you should look no further than the inclusion of HTML. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">HTML is short for Hyper Text Markup Language and is a standard markup language added when creating web pages for your site. This language is the structure of the page and will consist of a series of different elements to show the intended structure of the page. Without this element with the structure, the browser would be unsure and unable to display the content correctly. An example of HTML would be &lt;H&gt;10 Best Front End Development Languages To Develop Your Website &lt;/H&gt;. This tells the browser that the text is the title and to present it as such. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A basic front end development language, HTML should be viewed as a building block when it comes to the creation of web pages. Along with the creation of content and layout of the page, HTML tags can also be used to add visuals onto a page for the benefit of the viewer. </span></p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simple to Use</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ability to Integrate with other languages</span></li>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another best front end development language to consider and that is React.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the user experience is at the top of your priority list, then consider React through the user friendly elements and the speed and functionality of the pages. Simple to use, React is also compatible with most back end setups. The design layout of the page can be split into separate elements and components with a piece of code that represents a unique part of the page. This can allow you the web designer to edit and design separate parts separately with ease. </span></p>

<p>Here we’ll dive deep into the finest (&amp; various) options available in the market, in different sectors, some of which you weren’t even aware existed.</p>
<p>But first, let’s start with the fundamentals.</p>
<h2><strong>What is a Payment Gateway?</strong></h2>
<p>Payment gateways are the technologies used by sellers to accept debit/credit card payments from their customers.</p>
<p>This not only refers to the card reading devices often found in brick &amp; mortar stores but also points to the online systems making an entrance of consumer’s money in the seller&#8217;s pocket through the internet.</p>
<h2><strong><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21870" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Icons-1-1.png" alt="How does a payment gateway work" width="1265" height="461" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Icons-1-1.png 1265w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Icons-1-1-300x109.png 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Icons-1-1-768x280.png 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Icons-1-1-1024x373.png 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Icons-1-1-700x255.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1265px) 100vw, 1265px" /></strong></h2>
<h2><strong>How Does a Payment Gateway Works?</strong></h2>

<p>Here’s a detailed look into how a payment gateway works with each step broken down.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21871" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Icons-2.png" alt="How does a payment gateway work" width="1265" height="464" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Icons-2.png 1265w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Icons-2-300x110.png 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Icons-2-768x282.png 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Icons-2-1024x376.png 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Icons-2-700x257.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1265px) 100vw, 1265px" />Bingo, we now have a good understanding of what a payment gateway is and how its system bridges a financial model between the buyer and the seller.</p>
<p>The question now arises, what are some of the best payment gateways in Pakistan. Let’s find out by dividing the payment gateways available in Pakistan into different categories.</p>
<h2><strong>Best Payment Gateways in Pakistan – Banks </strong></h2>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the name suggests, <em>digital </em>marketing is all about automation &#8211; and the art of getting more done with less <em>effort</em>.</p>
<p>In other words, using intuitive automation tools such as chatbots to work smart, with speed, and deliver greater efficiency. At this point, it&#8217;s natural to wonder &#8211; &#8220;<em>Why chatbots?&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Good question.</p>
<p>First off, data suggests that <em>&#8220;Around </em><a href="https://www.smallbizgenius.net/by-the-numbers/chatbot-statistics/#gref"><em>1.4 billion </em></a><em>people are already using chatbots.&#8221; </em>All in all, chatbots are becoming ubiquitous.</p>
<p>Two, IBM claims that chatbots have the capability to answer as much as <a href="https://www.smallbizgenius.net/by-the-numbers/chatbot-statistics/#gref">80%</a> of the standard questions. Basically, that if trained right, chatbots can offer error-free results at lightspeed.</p>
<p>Three, there&#8217;s growing acceptance amongst businesses, sectors, and industries for adopting chatbots. Further research suggests that a staggering &#8220;<a href="https://www.smallbizgenius.net/by-the-numbers/chatbot-statistics/#gref"><em>$5 billion</em></a><em> will be invested in chatbots by 2021.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Long story short, chatbots are the future of <a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">digital marketing services</a>, and the future is now.</p>
<p>In this blog, we will look at the top-10 ways in which you can use chatbots to advance and enhance your digital marketing strategy. Let&#8217;s get started.</p>
<h2><strong>Top-10 Applications of Chatbot in Digital Marketing &#8211; Coupled with Real-World Examples</strong></h2>
<h3><strong style="font-size: 16px;">1. Connect with your Website Visitors</strong></h3>
<p>With nearly every business going online, owing to the global pandemic, this particular use-case comes in handy. Your customers today shop differently, on diverse platforms, and around-the-clock.</p>
<p>You can think of <a href="https://acquire.io/chatbot/">chatbots</a> as every customer&#8217;s personal virtual guide &#8212; ever-ready to answer customer queries and offer customized help:<a href="https://sumo.com/stories/ecommerce-chatbot-marketing"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-21816 size-full" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/12.jpg" alt="How chatbots connect with website visitors" width="837" height="648" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/12.jpg 837w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/12-300x232.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/12-768x595.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/12-700x542.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 837px) 100vw, 837px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://sumo.com/stories/ecommerce-chatbot-marketing">Image Source</a></p>
<p>Additionally, bots are extremely capable of answering routine questions and handling basic requests that do not require human effort or intervention. As you can imagine, this helps take some of the workload off of your already-overwhelmed CX, sales, and digital teams. As per data:</p>
<p>&#8220;<a href="https://www.smallbizgenius.net/by-the-numbers/chatbot-statistics/#gref">64% </a>of agents who use Chabot’s are free to spend their time solving more difficult and complex problems.&#8221; &#8211; SalesForce</p>
<p><strong><em>Key takeaway</em></strong><em>: The bots of today have evolved into smart and efficient online &#8216;agents&#8217; that can emulate conversations between live agents and customers. So make sure to keep this in mind when building your bot&#8217;s personality, tone, and style. Typically, bots that are warm, friendly, and helpful are the ones that get most of the traction. In short, chatbots delivering one-word robotic answers is a thing of the past. </em></p>
<h3><strong>2. Qualify and Nurture Leads</strong></h3>
<p>Whether your business is just starting out or whether it&#8217;s well-established, lead management can be a tiring and exhaustive process. You&#8217;ll be surprised to know that bots can lend a helping hand in capturing and nurturing leads. This can be done by programming them to help understand where your customers are in the sales funnel via a set of questions.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Here&#8217;s a useful example of how a Chabot helps nurture leads, particularly at odd times in a day:<a href="https://hybrid.chat/blog/chatbot-use-cases-what-bots-can-do-in-different-industries/"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-21817" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2-3.jpg" alt="Chatbots Qualify and Nurture Leads" width="580" height="636" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2-3.jpg 661w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2-3-274x300.jpg 274w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" /></a><strong><a href="https://hybrid.chat/blog/chatbot-use-cases-what-bots-can-do-in-different-industries/">Image Source</a></strong></p>
<p>So even if your customer service team is offline, none of your leads will go unnoticed or unanswered as the bot is available 24x7x365 to capture all important information (think: contact, email ID, name, etc.), find the right product/service for your customers, and contribute to <a href="https://outfunnel.com/b2b-lead-generation-ideas/">lead generation</a> round-the-clock.</p>
<p><strong><em>Key takeaway:</em></strong><em> Chatbots are capable of handling all the &#8216;grunt&#8217; work when it comes to lead generation &#8211; starting with capturing leads that land up on your website. That said, it is best to use live agents in conjunction with chatbots who can &#8216;close the deal&#8217; while the bots work on getting leads in the first place.   </em></p>
<h3><strong>3. Improve Team Performance &#8211; Especially with Remote Work</strong></h3>
<p>Remote work is on the rise, and teams are struggling to keep up as they continue to work-from-home. It has been seen that one of the major contributors to low productivity is unorganized, messy management. This is where bots can help.</p>
<p>They can assist your teams to stay accountable and in sync by automating and simplifying the organization process. As with customers, bots can ask employees a bunch of routine questions such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Which goals did you accomplish yesterday? </em></li>
<li><em>What projects and tasks are you working on today? </em></li>
<li><em>What kind of issues/challenges are you facing?</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Once the bot gathers all the important information, it organizes it and makes it &#8216;available&#8217; in a centralized place where team members can access it at the click of a button.</p>
<p><strong><em>Key takeaway:</em></strong><em> Organizational bots help enhance team performance in addition to delivering a host of benefits such as making teams accountable, helping them to stay on top of their goals, and eliminating any roadblocks by empowering teams to always stay in sync.</em></p>
<h3><strong>4. Customize the User Experience</strong></h3>
<p>A personalized experience is a coveted competitive differentiator for brands &#8211; big or small. The customers love it, with over <a href="https://www.marketingdive.com/news/study-71-of-consumers-prefer-personalized-ads/418831/">71%</a> of them preferring personalized ads. In fact, personalization is not just restricted to ads. Customers love personalized suggestions by brands and don&#8217;t mind sharing information if that guarantees them a more tailor-made experience that better suits their needs.</p>
<p>Bots can help customize the customer experience by asking a series of logical and sequential questions and gathering customer inputs so that they can offer relevant suggestions:</p>
<p>An excellent example of bot-led customization is CNN&#8217;s bot, which rolls out personalized news feeds to readers based on lists of predefined options:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><a href="https://neilpatel.com/blog/bots-digital-marketing-strategy/">Image Source</a></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Key takeaway:</em></strong><em> Numerous brands across the board today are making use of chatbots to gather critical data about the users so that they can offer a more relevant and personalized user experience. This sits well with the well-informed customers of today who are constantly looking for brands that can truly &#8216;understand&#8217; them &#8211; both literally and figuratively.</em></p>
<h3><strong>5. Combine the Power of Bots &amp; Instant Messaging &#8211; All Hail Facebook Messenger Bots</strong></h3>
<p>Did you know that<em> &#8220;There are over </em><a href="https://www.crowdspring.com/blog/facebook-messenger-marketing-guide/#:~:text=A%20Facebook%20Messenger%20chatbot%20or,active%20chatbots%20on%20Facebook%20Messenger."><em>300,000 </em></a><em>active chatbots on Facebook Messenger?&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Clearly, chatbots have made their way onto popular social media platforms and messaging apps such as Facebook, Slack, etc.</p>
<p>The real question then becomes &#8211; what&#8217;s led to this skyrocketing growth?</p>
<p>As per data by Facebook:</p>
<p>On the consumer side, over 59% of millennials and 60% of Gen Xers in the U.S. have interacted with chatbots. And according to a Facebook survey, more than half (53%) of customers say they’re more likely to shop with a business that they can connect with via chat.</p>
<p>Nearly <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/490424/number-of-worldwide-facebook-users/">one-fourth</a> of the world&#8217;s population is on Facebook, and as we saw, &#8216;messaging&#8217; has become second-nature to people of all generations.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Most eCommerce stores use Facebook Messenger bots to interact with customers and drive sales:<a href="https://neilpatel.com/blog/bots-digital-marketing-strategy/"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-21819" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/8.jpg" alt="Power of ChatBots &amp; Instant Messaging in Digital Marketing" width="580" height="636" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/8.jpg 661w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/8-274x300.jpg 274w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" /></a> <strong><a href="https://neilpatel.com/blog/bots-digital-marketing-strategy/">Image Source</a></strong></p>
<p>Hence, brands need to capitalize on this feature and communicate with customers on the latter&#8217;s preferred platform of choice. Additionally, bots can also assist your customers as well as employees should they get stuck while browsing through your social media pages.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Here&#8217;s another example of a witty and humorous Facebook Messenger Chabot for inspiration:<a href="https://medium.com/marketing-and-entrepreneurship/12-ready-made-facebook-messenger-chatbots-you-can-clone-today-a5e91a0060e"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-21820" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/9.jpg" alt="Power of Bots &amp; Instant Facebook Messages" width="580" height="636" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/9.jpg 661w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/9-274x300.jpg 274w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" /></a><strong><a href="https://medium.com/marketing-and-entrepreneurship/12-ready-made-facebook-messenger-chatbots-you-can-clone-today-a5e91a0060e">Image Source</a></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Key takeaway:</em></strong><em> Messaging platforms and chatbots are a match made in heaven. You can use Slack bots for demonstrating fun, more casual, and interactive content such as &#8220;behind the scenes of your organization,&#8221; while you can leverage Facebook Messenger bots to boost your leads.</em></p>
<h3><strong>6. Get to Know Your Customers Better</strong></h3>
<p>Going back to the basics, chatbots can be used to understand your customer&#8217;s demographics, behavioral patterns, shopping habits, preferences, and pain-points, among other things. After all, you can&#8217;t really create an impactful digital marketing strategy if you&#8217;re shooting blind.</p>
<p>By asking user-friendly and simple questions, the bot captures useful information. From the customer&#8217;s standpoint, it acts as a convenient way to gather data as the users don&#8217;t need to fill lengthy surveys or divulge useless information:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://botscrew.com/blog/facebook-ads-chatbots/"><strong><img class="aligncenter wp-image-21821" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/5-1.jpg" alt="Chatbots help you get to Know Your Customers Better" width="580" height="636" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/5-1.jpg 661w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/5-1-274x300.jpg 274w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" />Image Source</strong></a></p>
<p>Based on the information gathered, it can offer helpful tips and relevant suggestions, thereby enhancing the overall user experience and making it more positive throughout the customer&#8217;s life cycle.</p>
<h3><strong>7. Gather &amp; Analyze Useful Customer Feedback</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Every campaign or strategy is incomplete without measuring its effectiveness. One of the most effective ways to gauge its failure or success is by gathering user feedback, as shown below:<u><a href="https://surveybot.io/"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-21822" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/6-2.jpg" alt="Chatbots Analyze Customer Feedback" width="580" height="636" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/6-2.jpg 661w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/6-2-274x300.jpg 274w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" /></a></u></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><u><strong><a href="https://surveybot.io/">Image Source</a></strong></u></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><em>Key takeaway:</em></strong><em> All in all, chatbots are a seamless way to conduct customer-centric surveys, requiring minimal effort from the latter &#8211; a big plus, if you ask us. Plus, chatbots can engage with customers in a more informal and fun capacity by using GIFs, images, videos, etc. (as opposed to the boring, lengthy, and dull survey forms), thereby boosting customer engagement and encouraging more customers to participate in surveys.</em></p>
<h3><strong>8. Build a Knowledge Base &amp; Drive Rich Leads to Your  Assets</strong></h3>
<p>Circling back to the point of qualifying and nurturing leads, Chatbots also drives traffic to your website and other platforms by acting as a rich repository of the knowledge base. Take the following example:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/10/04/chatbots"><strong><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21823" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/7-1.jpg" alt="Chatbots Build a Knowledge Base &amp; Drive Quality" width="1224" height="648" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/7-1.jpg 1224w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/7-1-300x159.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/7-1-768x407.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/7-1-1024x542.jpg 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/7-1-700x371.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1224px) 100vw, 1224px" />Image Source</strong></a></p>
<p>In order to capture potential leads, the bot can offer in-depth and useful articles in exchange for their email IDs. The central idea is to converse with users in a thoughtful and engaging manner while boosting conversions and storing accurate information.</p>
<h3><strong>9. Up-Sell, Down-Sell, and Cross-Sell with Powerful Offers</strong></h3>
<p>&#8220;More than 70% of customers are interested in hearing from retailers after they make a purchase, especially if they provide personalized content.&#8221; &#8211; <a href="https://hbr.org/2016/05/online-retailers-should-care-more-about-the-post-purchase-experience">Harvard Business Review</a></p>
<p>Acquiring new customers is great, but retaining old ones is even better. So, if you wish to keep your loyal customers motivated and engaged, you can leverage the power of chatbots and offer deals, discounts, and incentives based on your customer&#8217;s shopping history</p>
<p>Additionally, bots can introduce customers to interesting upsell/down-sell offers and boost sales in the process:<img class="aligncenter wp-image-21824" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1-2.jpg" alt="Up-Sell, Down-Sell, and Cross-Sell with chatbots" width="580" height="636" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1-2.jpg 661w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1-2-274x300.jpg 274w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><a href="https://www.getjenny.com/blog/chatbot-use-cases-25-real-life-examples">Image Source</a></strong></p>
<p>In fact, one of the most brilliant examples of tracking the effectiveness of your promotional campaigns is using chatbot-exclusive discount codes (in this case &#8211; FRESHBOT25.)</p>
<p>As more and more customers download the app and use the code, the bot can track the number of customers that are coming in through the chatbot and analyze the campaign&#8217;s effectiveness.</p>
<h3><strong>10. Enhance the Overall Customer Experience </strong></h3>
<p>As we saw, chatbots can be used in varying capacities &#8211; from being a virtual Sales Assistant and onboarding products to assisting customers by showing demos and taking them on virtual tours of products/services, there&#8217;s much you can do.</p>
<p>Chatbots are increasingly becoming smarter and more conversational in nature, making the customer experience more detailed and positive.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not all. Chatbots can be equipped and trained to roll out interesting contests, quizzes, and giveaways periodically so that customers genuinely look forward to engaging with your brand across diverse touch-points.</p>
<h2><strong>Way Forward</strong></h2>
<p>&#8220;<a href="https://www.smallbizgenius.net/by-the-numbers/chatbot-statistics/#gref">85%</a> of customer interactions will be handled without human agents by 2021.&#8221; Chatbots Life</p>
<p>To wrap up, chatbots can be thought of as useful multi-tasking tools that can help you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Connect with your website visitors</li>
<li>Qualify and nurture leads</li>
<li>Improve the overall team performance</li>
<li>Personalize the customer experience</li>
<li>Interact with customers on popular platforms and enhance <a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/social-media-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">social media marketing</a></li>
<li>Get to know your customers better</li>
<li>Gather and analyze useful customer reviews</li>
<li>Build a knowledge base and drive rich leads to your resource assets</li>
<li>Up-sell, down-sell, and cross-sell with powerful deals and offers</li>
<li>Enhance the overall customer experience</li>
</ul>
<p>So, go back to the drawing board if you need to and take a hard look at your digital marketing strategy to see where you can leverage the multi-functional benefits of a chatbot and boost brand loyalty as well as customer happiness, one interaction at a time.</p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>SEO is an un-ignorable segment of digital marketing for businesses; most marketers will agree to it. However, it’s only considered effective when it can present results that are valuable to the business.</p>
<p>No matter if you’ve hired a digital agency, a freelancer, or an in-house SEO, you’re wasting your resources if you’re not tracking results if you&#8217;re not keeping them accountable, and most important if you don&#8217;t know how to measure SEO performance, nothing will impact much.</p>
<p>But exactly why is it such a deal to track your SEO results?</p>
<p>Let’s have a systematic look at why measuring your SEO performance is not only important but is the basis of your entire marketing efforts.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Why SEO Measurement Matters for Your Business?</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Investing in SEO doesn&#8217;t mean the following vanity metrics that you don&#8217;t even understand. It means investing in a medium that has high business driving potential and possesses incredible scalability.</p>
<p>Basically, by measuring your SEO performance you’re getting the answers to 3 questions that are extremely valuable for your business.</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignnone wp-image-21811 size-full" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Icons.png" alt="SEO Measurement tracks business performance " width="1365" height="591" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Icons.png 1365w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Icons-300x130.png 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Icons-768x333.png 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Icons-1024x443.png 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Icons-700x303.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1365px) 100vw, 1365px" /></strong></p>
<p><strong>Is your business growing with SEO?</strong></p>
<p>Irrespective of what digital marketing segment you’re targeting, the goal at the end is always the growth of your business.</p>
<p>Let it be short term or long term, direct or indirect, the final aim is to grow strong roots for the business in the market. Thus by measuring the SEO KPI’s you’re directly measuring how much of an impact SEO has to help you achieve your business goals.</p>
<p><strong>Is SEO cost-effective for you?</strong></p>
<p>It’s always good to see some pages ranking better and your website providing a better user experience, however, what matters, in the end, is if your SEO is cost-effective for you?</p>
<p>The SEO KPI’s, with little understanding, will help an average business owner recognize if SEO is generating an outcome for their business.</p>
<p><strong>Is SEO the right marketing approach for you?</strong></p>
<p>Depending on the results you’re getting for your business and the progress you’re seeing in terms of SEO KPIs you can answer for yourself if SEO was the right approach for your business. The major variable factor here would be the industries.</p>
<p>Also if you look at it in comparison with the other marketing channels (SEO, social media, emails, etc.) you’ll know exactly what area do you need to scale in the future for the most growth.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><strong>What KPIs to Track for Effective SEO Measurement?</strong></h2>
<p>We’ve looked at the value SEO result’s measurement brings.</p>
<p>However, the question is, how does an average non-technical business owner know what “results” mean when it comes to SEO?</p>
<p>What exact key-performance indicators (KPI’s) should you track if you’ve invested your time &amp; energy in SEO?</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21812" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Icons_1.jpg" alt="KPIs to Track for Effective SEO Measurement" width="1365" height="640" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Icons_1.jpg 1365w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Icons_1-300x141.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Icons_1-768x360.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Icons_1-1024x480.jpg 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Icons_1-700x328.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1365px) 100vw, 1365px" /></p>
<h3><strong>1. Keyword’s Rankings</strong></h3>
<p>Nothing comes more obvious than Keyword rankings. Still for those who aren’t aware; Keyword’s rankings are the position your webpages are showing up on for respective targeted queries.</p>
<p>For example, if your target keyword was<strong> Paleo Diet </strong>and let’s says your website was ranking on the <strong>8th page</strong> when you started investing your time and resources into SEO, after a few months you should see it in a better position.</p>
<p>Of course, everyone would want their website ranking on the 1<sup>st</sup> result for all their targeted keyword. However, it won’t be the case. Some of your keywords will be ranked higher and some might not even make it to the 1<sup>st</sup> page at all.</p>
<p>However if collectively your keywords are ranking good overall (or are improving progressively), you’re moving in the right direction.</p>
<p><strong>How to track keywords rankings?</strong></p>
<p>Other than simply noting down the position of your website every month for particular keywords in a Google sheet, you’d have to use some kind of a keyword tracking tool as well. For this purpose, the Google search console is a good option.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21782" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/14.png" alt="Google Search Console UI" width="958" height="517" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/14.png 958w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/14-300x162.png 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/14-768x414.png 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/14-700x378.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 958px) 100vw, 958px" /></p>
<p>However, Google search console has its own limitations like not being able to track your competitor’s keywords positioning. Also, it doesn’t have a magnificently attractive user-interface either.</p>
<p>Thus you can also rely on some premium tools like Moz, SEMRush, and Ahrefs which let you keep a regular check on your keywords in a more convenient manner. Other than a better UI these tools (Ahref’s Keyword Explorer for example) give you a lot more insights and metrics like <strong>Keyword Difficulty</strong> which helps you contextualize a keyword’s ability to rank and generate business once ranked.</p>
<p><strong><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21784" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1.png" alt="Ahrefs Keyword Explorer UI" width="1266" height="705" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1.png 1266w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1-300x167.png 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1-768x428.png 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1-1024x570.png 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1-700x390.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1266px) 100vw, 1266px" />Why the keyword rankings are important?</strong></p>
<p>The position your website ranks on for a particular keyword will determine how visitors will it acquire from the search results.</p>
<p>In fact, the click-through rate gap between the 1st result and the 10<sup>th</sup> result on Google is remarkably high. Several studies have mentioned that the website ranking on the 1<sup>st</sup> position on Google gets around 32.5% of the entire clicks while the last one gets only 1.5%.</p>
<p><strong><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21785" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/9.png" alt="CTR Distribution in Google Rankings" width="751" height="831" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/9.png 751w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/9-271x300.png 271w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/9-700x775.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 751px) 100vw, 751px" />How not to think about Keyword’s Rankings?</strong></p>
<p>Now it’s very important to understand that SEO can be highly unpredictable. So expecting that your website will rank on a particular position after certain days isn’t the right way of thinking about this.</p>
<h2><strong>2. Organic Search Traffic</strong></h2>
<p>We all know that both SEOs and a business owner, who have invested in <a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/seo-services/">SEO services</a>, crave for organic traffic on their website. In fact, higher keyword rankings are nothing but an indicator of your website potentially receiving more organic traffic.</p>
<p>Note: Organic traffic is the traffic coming from search engines like Google as a result of efforts put into SEO.</p>
<p><strong>How to Track Organic Traffic?</strong></p>
<p>Organic traffic can be tracked if your website has a tracking code embedded in it of whatever the tool you want to track it with.</p>
<p>The best one is Google Analytics in this regard. Embedding the tracking code in your website’s header or footer, you can track every visitor coming to any of your web-pages and know the source of its visitors as well.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21786" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/19.png" alt="Organic Traffic in Google Analytics" width="958" height="449" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/19.png 958w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/19-300x141.png 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/19-768x360.png 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/19-700x328.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 958px) 100vw, 958px" />Google analytics has some tremendous sections which can give you useful insights about your organic traffic leading you to better SEO performance over time.</p>
<p><strong>Why Organic Traffic is important?</strong></p>
<p>One can argue that organic traffic is one of the topmost important metrics to track when it comes to SEO.</p>
<p>The reason?</p>
<p>Because all these visitors are actual people visiting your webpages with a particular intent. Either they’re interested in your product/service or the information you’ve provided relevant to your product/service.</p>
<p>In simple words, they’re your potential customers. Or at least some proportion of them is.</p>
<p>Secondly, since this traffic is dedicatedly the users clicking on your website from search engine result pages (not social media, email, or any other channel) you’ll get an exact idea of where your SEO is moving overall.</p>
<p><strong>How NOT to think about Organic Traffic?</strong></p>
<p>Not all traffic coming from search engines would be beneficial to your business. When it comes to organic traffic, it’s highly dependent on the keywords you’ve targeted. And what matters the most is the <strong>search intent</strong> of the user behind those keywords.</p>
<p>For example, if your business is about <strong>furniture</strong>, and the traffic on your website is coming from a blog post you wrote expressing your <strong>political views in the furniture industry</strong>, it won’t benefit at all. Since all those visitors are visiting with different search intent.</p>
<p>It’s not that all this traffic would be hazardous; it’s just that it will hardly move the needle for your business.</p>
<h2><strong>3. Backlinks </strong></h2>
<p>Backlinks have been nominated as the most important and sometimes the top 3 most important ranking factor when it comes to SEO.</p>
<p>Backlinks are simply the links pointed toward your website from other platforms or other websites.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21787" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/26.png" alt="What is a backlink" width="958" height="539" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/26.png 958w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/26-300x169.png 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/26-768x432.png 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/26-700x394.png 700w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/26-539x303.png 539w" sizes="(max-width: 958px) 100vw, 958px" />Google bot crawls the web on the basis of links primarily. Having more quality backlinks will directly correlate to higher search engine rankings and thus more traffic.</p>
<p><strong>How to Track Backlinks?</strong></p>
<p>For knowing about the backlinks your website already has, Google search console can be helpful. Just click on the ‘Links’ button in the sidebar and in the ‘External Links’ section you’ll find the backlinks your website has.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21788" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3.png" alt="Backlinks tracking in Google Search Console" width="1266" height="621" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3.png 1266w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3-300x147.png 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3-768x377.png 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3-1024x502.png 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3-700x343.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1266px) 100vw, 1266px" />Although Google search console does a fine job of listing the links our website has, there are still some better options, solely for this purpose.</p>
<p>For example, if you’re running an active link building campaign for your website, then the Google Search Console would have limited data. The reason is your lack of competitor’s data and the lack of links tracking with respect to time. In such cases, tools like <strong>Ahrefs and SEMrush</strong> are the best options.</p>
<p><strong><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21789" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2-2.jpg" alt="Backlinks tracking in Ahrefs Site Explorer" width="1266" height="618" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2-2.jpg 1266w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2-2-300x146.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2-2-768x375.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2-2-1024x500.jpg 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2-2-700x342.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1266px) 100vw, 1266px" />Why are B</strong><strong>acklinks Important?</strong></p>
<p>The links pointing to your website from other websites work just like endorsements for Google. That’s exactly it’s pointed our various times that not all links are created equal.</p>
<p>Backlinks coming from authoritative websites will have a higher impact than those coming from a newly developed website.</p>
<p>The primary reason for this distinction is that backlinks coming from a site is as strong as the own link profile of that website.</p>
<p>Thus when you receive a link from a website/web-page that itself has many links, your website takes a prominent jump in the search results. Link Juice is a term used by SEOs to define the value of a link passed on. This is how it works;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21790" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/18.png" alt="Link Juice Explanation " width="772" height="483" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/18.png 772w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/18-300x188.png 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/18-768x480.png 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/18-700x438.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 772px) 100vw, 772px" /></p>
<p>Here the <strong>webpage A</strong> has higher ranking capabilities than <strong>webpage B</strong> and it&#8217;s because of the fact that it&#8217;s receiving inbound links from more external websites compared to webpage B.</p>
<p>In simple words, how Google sees it is that if a well-established credible website links to another website, then the other one must be a credible resource as well.</p>
<p><strong>How NOT to Think About Backlinks?</strong></p>
<p>We’ve already established the fact that not all links are created equal. Neither should your approach towards link building be binary.</p>
<p>For example, if your website is about gardening and you get a link from an immigration company somewhere in the footer, it won’t help as much.</p>
<p>The reason is that all the factors that contribute to the strength of a backlink have been neglected. Some of those factors are;</p>
<ul>
<li>Relevancy</li>
<li>Anchor text</li>
<li>Surrounding text</li>
<li>Links Location on page</li>
<li>Link attribute used</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21791" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/23.png" alt="Backlinks Relevancy " width="958" height="539" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/23.png 958w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/23-300x169.png 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/23-768x432.png 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/23-700x394.png 700w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/23-539x303.png 539w" sizes="(max-width: 958px) 100vw, 958px" />These are just some of the factors that contribute to the strength of the backlinks you’re acquiring and the impact you’ll be able to see as a result of them.</p>
<h2><strong>4. Bounce Rate</strong></h2>
<p>The bounce rate is a user-metric that can potentially lead to higher or lower search engine rankings. A higher bounce rate means the users visit your website and then immediately bounces back to the search results.</p>
<p>The bounce rate is usually evaluated for the whole website as an average of the bounce rate per lading page on the site.</p>
<p>If users visit your website and navigate through different pages and then close the browser, it’d mean that they never bounced back. It represents that they came to your website, got their query answered, and left.</p>
<p>The same would be the case if the visitors bounce back to the search engine but type a totally different query this time.</p>
<p><strong>How to Measure the Bounce Rate?</strong></p>
<p>Your website’s bounce rate can be measured by looking at Google analytics. From the sidebar, click; <strong>Audience &gt; Overview </strong>and the following page will open up. At the pointed positions you can see the site-wide bounce rate of the website;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21792" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/7.png" alt="Bounce rate in Google Search Console " width="1266" height="621" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/7.png 1266w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/7-300x147.png 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/7-768x377.png 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/7-1024x502.png 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/7-700x343.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1266px) 100vw, 1266px" />One can also look at the bounce rate for the individual pages from the Google analytics report. Simply go to the; <strong>Acquisition &gt; Search Console &gt; Landing Pages</strong> to sort the data with respect to the landing pages on the website.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21793" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/5.png" alt="Bounce rate in Google Analytics by Landing Pages" width="1266" height="621" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/5.png 1266w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/5-300x147.png 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/5-768x377.png 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/5-1024x502.png 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/5-700x343.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1266px) 100vw, 1266px" />Note: You’ll have to connect Google Analytics with Google Search Console in order to get this data.</p>
<p><strong>Why Measuring Bounce Rate is Important?</strong></p>
<p>Google’s ultimate goal is to please and satisfy its users. And one metric of measuring searcher’s satisfaction with the result they’ve landed on is the bounce rate. A higher bounce rate would indicate that the searchers couldn’t find the answer they were looking for on your web-page.</p>
<p>If the searcher bounced back and clicked on some other result on Google search results, that’d indicate that the second website seemed like a better option for this query.</p>
<p>The result? The other website will outrank yours.</p>
<p>This phenomenon is called <strong>Pogo-Sticking</strong>.</p>
<p>Thus keeping a measure on your website’s bounce rate would give you an understanding of how pleased is your visitor with your website and if your website is solving the searcher’s query perfectly.</p>
<p><strong>How NOT to Think About the Bounce Rate?</strong></p>
<p>While the bounce rate is a highly important metric, it can also be misleading if you’ve not done your industrial research. A higher bounce rate is not always bad. The industry is a variable in this regard.</p>
<p>For example, if I am trying to find some <a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/">digital marketing services</a> then I’ll land on the website and navigate through the pages representing SEO, Social media, Design &amp; Development services.</p>
<p>That means a lower bounce rate. However if I am searching for a very specific problem; such as <strong><em>“How to access iCloud photos”</em></strong> I’ll land on the website, scan the page, find and read the specific paragraph that solves my problem, and will leave the website (bounce back).</p>
<p>I’ve got my answer, and I am a happy visitor even though I’ve raised the bounce rate. This isn’t problematic since I am not searching with the same query over and over again now.</p>
<p>So it’s more about the industry you’re playing in. Although there’s no certain answer with respect to industries, still we’ve gathered the bounce rate ranges data with respect to the industry a website is a part of.</p>
<h2><strong><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21794" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/4.png" alt="Bounce rate ranges by Industries " width="839" height="621" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/4.png 839w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/4-300x222.png 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/4-768x568.png 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/4-700x518.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 839px) 100vw, 839px" />5. Click-Through Rate</strong></h2>
<p>Click-through-rate is one of the primary metrics visible in the search console or Google analytics. In simple words, it’s the percentage of the users who click your Google search result out of all those who see it.</p>
<p>In a slightly more technical (and mathematical) definition, it’s the ratio between <strong>clicks and the impressions</strong> on your website receives from Google.</p>
<p><strong><img class="aligncenter wp-image-21795" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/11-1024x423.png" alt="CTR Formula" width="549" height="227" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/11-1024x423.png 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/11-300x124.png 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/11-768x317.png 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/11-700x289.png 700w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/11.png 1049w" sizes="(max-width: 549px) 100vw, 549px" /></strong></p>
<p><strong>How to Measure Click-Through-Rate?</strong></p>
<p>You don’t need any third-party tool or product in order to measure click-through-rate (CTR). You can access data from Google search console and Google analytics provided that you have the search console connected to Google analytics.</p>
<p>Here’s how it looks in the Google Search Console;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21796" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/17.png" alt="CTR in Google Search Console " width="958" height="517" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/17.png 958w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/17-300x162.png 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/17-768x414.png 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/17-700x378.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 958px) 100vw, 958px" />And here’s how CTR can be noted from Google Analytics;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21797" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/8.png" alt="CTR in Google Analytics" width="1266" height="621" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/8.png 1266w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/8-300x147.png 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/8-768x377.png 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/8-1024x502.png 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/8-700x343.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1266px) 100vw, 1266px" /></p>
<p>Just like all other metrics you can note the change in CTR for your whole website or any individual web-pages.</p>
<p><strong>Why Measuring CTR is Important?</strong></p>
<p>Measuring CTR is important for your overall SEO efforts in two ways.</p>
<p>First of all, you can see how effectively you have written your page’s Meta title that is displayed in the Google search results. In case the CTR is high, it means more people, who see your website on Google click it.</p>
<p>In case it’s low, it means people go through it in the search results but ignore clicking it like many mediocre websites.</p>
<p>Other than that, a higher CTR indirectly gives Google a signal that your website is satisfying the users that are searching for a particular query. And when you achieve a CTR higher than your competitors, your website will most likely be able to outrank them easily and get that more chunk of traffic.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://backlinko.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Backlinko</a></strong> did highly useful research in regards to this. Here&#8217;s the relation they discovered between CTR and Google search rankings;</p>
<p><strong><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21798" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/15.png" alt="CTR Study by Backlinko " width="958" height="901" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/15.png 958w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/15-300x282.png 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/15-768x722.png 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/15-700x658.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 958px) 100vw, 958px" />How NOT to Think About Increasing CTR? </strong></p>
<p>The problem most noob SEOs get themselves into is that in order to achieve a higher CTR for their website, they write click-bait Meta titles and descriptions. That does sound like a “smart” tactic if you believe Google is a dumb platform. They’re not!</p>
<p>Google’s advanced search algorithm tracks not only user metrics but also user behaviors. And when your visitor clicks in your click-bait titles, what do you think is going to happen? They’ll not find what they were looking for and will bounce back immediately indicating that your web page was nowhere closes to satisfying them with the result.</p>
<p>So what do we do instead? Satisfy searcher’s intent honestly and add click boosters in your Meta title and descriptions. Here’ are some examples of boosters to increase your CTR;</p>
<ul>
<li>Add numbers for credibility</li>
<li>Add dates for content freshness</li>
<li>Ask a Question to develop curiosity</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, instead of just writing; <strong>“Exercising tips for men” </strong>write something like; <strong>“10 Incredibly Effective Exercising Tips for Men Look Fit in 2020”.</strong></p>
<p>Certainly, asking a professional copywriter or <a href="https://www.essaysupply.com/writers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">essay writer online</a> to create top-notch meta descriptions and titles Google will love is something you should consider</p>
<h2><strong>6. Traffic Value</strong></h2>
<p>Measuring the website’s traffic is binary and can be done with one tracking code of Google analytics. But how do you know that the traffic your website is receiving every day is valuable to your business and the results are profitable for you overall?</p>
<p>One way of it is by looking at the keywords you’re targeting on your website. If they resonate with your product/service and business, you’re on the right track.</p>
<p>But how do we give a quantitative value to our website’s traffic?</p>
<p>One good metric for this is <strong>traffic value</strong>.</p>
<p>Traffic value for any website is the amount in dollars the same traffic would have cost to be acquired from paid search mediums instead of organic.</p>
<p>In simple words, it let you imagine the amount of money you’d have spent to get the traffic you’re getting right now if it wasn’t from SEO.</p>
<p><strong>How to Measure Traffic Value?</strong></p>
<p>Just to be clear, traffic value isn’t a metric provided or followed by Google. It’s a third-party metric like many other metrics like Domain Authority, Links velocity, etc.</p>
<p>Tools like Ahrefs, SEMRush, MorningScore, and many others give a unique traffic value to each website depending on the keyword your website ranks for.</p>
<p>Traffic value is found by multiplying the monthly paid traffic of each keyword with its CPC value.</p>
<p><strong><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21799" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/24.png" alt="Traffic value in Ahrefs" width="958" height="539" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/24.png 958w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/24-300x169.png 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/24-768x432.png 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/24-700x394.png 700w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/24-539x303.png 539w" sizes="(max-width: 958px) 100vw, 958px" /></strong></p>
<p><strong><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21800" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/25.png" alt="Traffic value in SEMRush" width="958" height="514" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/25.png 958w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/25-300x161.png 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/25-768x412.png 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/25-700x376.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 958px) 100vw, 958px" /></strong></p>
<p><strong>Why Measuring Traffic Value is Important?</strong></p>
<p>For people who aren’t as technical as a senior and experienced SEO, measuring the SEO efforts, even in terms of the website traffic, can be a little problematic.</p>
<p>Let’s say if I have chosen SEO over PPC and I am investing 3000$ per month on my website’s SEO. How do I know if my decision of choosing SEO was right? E</p>
<p>Even if I am getting good website traffic and sales how do I know if PPC would not have brought the same traffic under the same monetary value?</p>
<p>That’s where metrics like Traffic value come in. By giving an estimate of the amount you’d have to pay if you were to get those results via PPC, traffic value ensures that you picked the right thing for your business; SEO.</p>
<p><strong>How NOT to Think About Traffic Value?</strong></p>
<p>First of all, none of these third party tools are actually 100% when it comes to measuring traffic value for your website. The primary reason for this is that they’re not sure of the exact monthly or daily traffic your website is getting.</p>
<p>Thus you can’t bet all your measurements just on traffic value since its overall quantitative value would always be an estimation. It can be a close estimation but it will never be the perfect one.</p>
<h2><strong>7. Goals Completions</strong></h2>
<p>A goal is a specific action you want your visitor to take on your website. For example, it can be to fill a form, signup to your newsletter, buy products from your eCommerce store, or inquire about your services via the contact form.</p>
<p>Whenever a visitor on your website performs the action that you’ve specified to track, Google analytics tracking code can track it. The biggest benefit of it is precise data and better future tracking.</p>
<p><strong>How to Measure Goals Conversions?</strong></p>
<p>One of the best things about internet marketing as a whole is that tracking is really easy. Irrespective of the type of business you’re running online; an eCommerce store, a personal blog selling Ebooks, a local business website, etc. you can easily track every lead coming your way specifically from organic traffic.</p>
<p>You can create Goals in Google analytics and track any action that could be distinguished as a conversion. For example, a universal yet simple practice is putting a call to action or a contact form on the landing page that is receiving traffic from search engines.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21801" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/13.png" alt="Goals in Google Analytics " width="1266" height="621" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/13.png 1266w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/13-300x147.png 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/13-768x377.png 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/13-1024x502.png 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/13-700x343.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1266px) 100vw, 1266px" /></p>
<p>As soon as any visitor performs the specified action, it’ll be tracked as one goal completion.</p>
<p><strong>Why Measuring Goals Completion is Important?</strong></p>
<p>Every wise SEO believes that SEO is more about revenue than it is about rankings. In fact, rankings become kind of a vanity metric when it comes to measuring revenue and sales as a result of your SEO efforts.</p>
<p>The reason? Well, all marketing efforts are directed primarily to the following two goals;</p>
<ul>
<li>Sales</li>
<li>Brand awareness</li>
</ul>
<p>And SEO is nothing more than a digital marketing channel pursuing the accomplishment of the exact same goals as above.</p>
<p>Even the KPIs we mentioned earlier in the post is directly related to leads/business generation at the very end.</p>
<p><strong><img class="aligncenter wp-image-21802 size-full" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/21.png" alt="User journey from visitor to customer " width="812" height="425" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/21.png 812w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/21-300x157.png 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/21-768x402.png 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/21-700x366.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 812px) 100vw, 812px" /></strong></p>
<p><strong>How NOT to Look at Goals Conversions?</strong></p>
<p>The goal conversion in Google’s analytics means a different thing for every business owner. Thus first of all it’s important to understand the data in context to your business in specific and secondly you have to build systems to take the data to the next phase.</p>
<p>For example, let’s take our example. We’re a digital marketing agency and we get a lot of inbound leads (goal conversions) as a result of our overall marketing efforts; SEO, PPC, Email, Social, etc.</p>
<p>Now we have the data in Google analytics. But to keep it real, our <strong>sales team</strong> engages in, and apart from handling all the leads and converting them to clients, we also organize the data in a humane way. For example, if someone on our website fills a form twice, our team will count it one. It helps to avoid data irregularities overall.</p>
<p>In the same way, it’s important that you keep a record of your conversions, let it be eCommerce sales, clients, or sign-ups.</p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion </strong></h2>
<p>Measuring SEO does seem like rocket science but it’s not. All you need to do is demand the following;</p>
<ul>
<li>A clear goal and an action plan</li>
<li>Monthly performance reports</li>
</ul>
<p>Measuring the KPI’s we shared will make you enough of a pro to discuss and debate your SEO campaign with the agency you’ve hired.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Software as a Service or SAAS is gaining momentum and popularity amongst businesses operating in a diverse range of industries, owing to its cloud features and relatively cheap cost.</p>
<p>While SAAS is popular amongst users, the software developers and marketers find it extremely difficult to design and market a SAAS software.</p>
<p>This is happening because of two reasons. One, software developers must think of innovative and unique ways of to introduce a feature(s) that give their product an edge over competitors.</p>
<p>In addition, they are faced with another dilemma; the feature that they introduce must be affordable and ideally should be less than the market price. The second issue pertains to marketers, who often find themselves in the dogfight of customers and advertisement platforms.</p>
<p>However, despite the enormous problems’ marketers face when advertising SAAS businesses, <a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/social-media-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">social media marketing</a> stays a popular choice.</p>
<p>If you wish to promote your SAAS business using social media platforms, read this guide and increase the scale and sales of your business.</p>
<p>This guide will be divided into four parts: before and after launch, increasing reach, and conclusion.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Before Launching Your SAAS Product </strong></h2>
<p>The pre-launch is an incredibly crucial time wherein marketers and engineers should sit down and gauge with each other. Marketers should understand the product as much as possible so that they devise a tactful and effective marketing strategy.</p>
<h3><strong>1. Define your audience</strong></h3>
<p>Conduct research online and off-line about prospective audiences and clients, for better results, talk to competitors’ customers and ask them about the issues they face when using their current SAAS software and try to remove the issues from your product.</p>
<p>For instance, before launching its vitalized platform, Netflix used Facebook and other platforms to gauge with the audience to ask questions about their video streaming experience and how much would they be willing to pay for a service that gave them access to millions of movies and television shows from across the world.</p>
<p>The surveys gave them the opportunity to collect emails and names of potential customers.</p>
<p>Much to their surprise, about 75% of the respondents responded in the affirmative, and when Netflix relaunched itself in 2013, it had gained over 30 million subscribers in one year.</p>
<h3><strong>2. Identify vital social media channels</strong></h3>
<p>While the old saying goes that you should not put all your eggs in one basket, it does not stand for social media.</p>
<p>Social media advertisement isn’t cheap, therefore, you’ll have to do your research and identify which social media platform well-suited to promote your SAAS business and you should advertise on it conveniently.</p>
<p>Netflix, for instance, used YouTube to promote itself since the latter is a video-streaming website and has over two billion users.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-21760 size-full" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1-1.jpg" alt="Netflix as a SAAS Product ran ads on Youtube " width="1365" height="872" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1-1.jpg 1365w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1-1-300x192.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1-1-768x491.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1-1-1024x654.jpg 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1-1-700x447.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1365px) 100vw, 1365px" /></p>
<p>This gave it the opportunity to showcase its content to a global audience and increase its reach.</p>
<h3><strong>3. Develop pre-launch interest</strong></h3>
<p>Create interest and curiosity among your targeted audience before formally launching your product by having an active social media presence, indulging in paid partnerships with social media influencers, and increasing your presence on topical websites, such as Quora, Reddit, and etc.</p>
<p>The key to a successful social media campaign is that you give very little information in the most creative ways; one way to do this by writing less and redirecting the post towards your website.</p>
<p>Also, here are a few pointers that you should keep in mind when developing a pre-launch interest:</p>
<ul>
<li>What problem does my SAAS product solve?</li>
<li>How valuable would this solution be to the user?</li>
<li>How do I be innovative in my consumer-approach</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s how a <a href="https://www.funnelcrm.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Funnel CRM</strong></a>, a famous CRM Software for businesses, created curiosity, with their abstract concepts on social media;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21761" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3-1.jpg" alt="Funnel CRM Posts on Instagram developing curiosity in consumers mind" width="1365" height="1164" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3-1.jpg 1365w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3-1-300x256.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3-1-768x655.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3-1-1024x873.jpg 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3-1-700x597.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1365px) 100vw, 1365px" />See how creatively Funnel CRM not only placed their product as a modern world solution to an old age problem but also made the creative catchy and attractive enough to grab your attention.</p>
<h3><strong>4. Create a community around your product</strong></h3>
<p>Create a group of hard-core community of diehard followers by either creating a Facebook page or group or an email list and advertise your product in this group.</p>
<p>Advertise your product in the community, but do NOT give away the product entirely. In this community, you could offer financial and non-financial incentives like a discount, lifetime access to the SAAS product at incredibly low costs, or give rewards for the first fifty sign-ups, etc.</p>
<p>Another way to gauge your community is by maintaining special records and lists of potential leads and early sign-ups and you should convert them into your die-hard followers.</p>
<p>You must bear in mind that the initial sign-ups are your biggest assets and they deserve to be treated in a special way.</p>
<p>Also, the first sign-ups can be an excellent group for alpha testing.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>After Launching the SAAS Product</strong></h2>
<p>Once the product is launched, your marketing strategies will change and will be more about increasing your product’s scale and reach.</p>
<h3><strong>1. Start Putting Out Content</strong></h3>
<p>Once your product has been launched, there are no secrets to keep or hide. But the job now is that you educate the audience about your product and its features. But, most importantly, you must convince them as to why they should switch to your product.</p>
<p>While doing so, you should put the focus on the following aspects of your product:</p>
<ul>
<li>Its features</li>
<li>What does it do?</li>
<li>What new feature(s) does your product offer?</li>
<li>Why should customers take the leap to your product?</li>
</ul>
<p>At this point, you should aggressively engage in social media posting and content promotion. The key is to educate the consumer about your product and elaborate on its features.</p>
<p>The more likely the audience will understand it the more they’ll be inquisitive about it</p>
<p>We already know how aggressively Ahrefs promote and do marketing of their SEO SAAS product on social media.</p>
<p>Let it be Youtube Videos, Blog Posts promotion on Facebook and LinkedIn, or random clicks showcasing their office’s culture, they’ve always done a fascinating job at engaging the user with their content.</p>
<p>However, this time let’s look at their pattern when they’ve just launched a new feature within their product; <strong>Ahrefs Webmaster Tool</strong>.</p>
<p>In short, it’s a free tool that allows you to dig insightful data to track and measure your website’s overall performance. But the interesting part is how they promoted this new feature across various social media platforms.</p>
<p>Ahrefs created a buzz anywhere they could with the announcement. Here all that we’ve been seeing on some of the famous social platforms since their new feature’s launch;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21767" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2-1.jpg" alt="Ahrefs Webmaster Tool Promotion on Social Media" width="1365" height="1292" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2-1.jpg 1365w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2-1-300x284.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2-1-768x727.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2-1-1024x969.jpg 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2-1-700x663.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1365px) 100vw, 1365px" /></p>
<ul>
<li>They created a full video tutorial &amp; posted on YouTube/Facebook/LinkedIn</li>
<li>They promoted their tool directly on LinkedIn/Facebook/Instagram</li>
</ul>
<p>That is how it’s to be done for your SAAS business as well; in a full invasive mode.</p>
<h3><strong>2. Test Various Forms of Content</strong></h3>
<p>With many people using different forms of social media, it is becoming increasingly difficult to pinpoint which channel will be most suited for your product.</p>
<p>Therefore, it&#8217;s best if you advertise your product in every medium. However, an effective way to engage the audience would be by diversifying your content advertising techniques.</p>
<p>You should not stick to one form of content, instead, you should be as experimental as possible.</p>
<p>Try incorporating images, infographics, data graphs, podcasts, videos, and audio clips to enhance the reachability of your content. This is important because people absorb and understand the content in different ways.</p>
<p>Therefore, to ensure that your business reaches a large audience, you must experiment with the various forms of content.</p>
<p>The following forms of content can be may help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Written posts (with/without images)</li>
<li>Link to External content</li>
<li>Short/Long Videos</li>
<li>Detailed Infographics</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>3. Partner with Social Media Influencers</strong></h3>
<p>The social media, especially Instagram, is filled with influencers, but a handful of them are techno-influencers.</p>
<p>Therefore, the biggest challenge for you when partnering with social media influencers would be to find trustworthy and reputable influencers who understand technology, its uses, your product, and are successfully able to help you sell your product.</p>
<p>However, there are some tips and tricks to find and partner with social media influencers.</p>
<ul>
<li>Search about relevant influencers in your industry using platforms such as Google, Quora, and Trendspotter and get in touch with them.</li>
<li>Search some hashtags relevant to your SAAS product’s nature on platforms like Instagram or Twitter. Then go check various posts that show up and analyze their accounts to see if they qualify as an influencer.</li>
<li>Look at the influencers promoting your competitor’s SAAS product. Even if you’re not interested in partnering with them, you may find a whole circle of influencers you can reach out to.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>4. Engage &amp; Be Responsive Towards Your Followers</strong></h3>
<p>When you have running and established communities around your SAAS product and have achieved a customer base, you must be responsive to them all the time.</p>
<p>Not only should you reply to comments, respond to messages and emails, but you should also post regularly, and maintain an active social media account. An active social media presence will gauge the audience and they will use it to reach out to you if they face any issues.</p>
<p>Also, your audience as well as certain social media platforms, such as Facebook, rate you on your response time; the lesser the response time, the higher the rating.</p>
<p>Jay Baer, the founder of Convince &amp; Convert, an online company that specializes in digital marketing reported that 42% of consumers expect a response within an hour, and 32% expect a response within half an hour.</p>
<p>Let’s take the example of <a href="https://slidebean.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Slidebean</strong></a>, a startup presentation, and pitch desk creating software.</p>
<p>Apart from producing great quality and highly informative videos relevant to their niche, they do something that’s amazing for a YouTube channel with <strong>174K subscribers</strong>. They reply to every single comment on their videos.</p>
<p>Not just that, sometimes they do reply being specific to the comment which makes it more valuable for the commenter.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21762" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/4-1.jpg" alt="SlideBean as a SAAS Product Replying to each consumer on social media" width="1365" height="1513" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/4-1.jpg 1365w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/4-1-271x300.jpg 271w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/4-1-768x851.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/4-1-924x1024.jpg 924w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/4-1-700x776.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1365px) 100vw, 1365px" />The sooner you respond, the better the customer perception, which is an integral trait to possess in the digital market, he emphasizes.</p>
<p>In addition, if a customer has been treated badly by your brand and posts a bad review online, the word will get out quickly, which can give bad meat to your competitors to chew.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is extremely crucial for your company to respond to customers’ feedback in a timely manner.</p>
<p>Once you have launched and established your product, now you must focus on increasing its reach.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Scaling the Reach for Your SAAS Product</strong></h2>
<p>You&#8217;ve put out a great product in the market, your business is moving towards stability each day, and is progressing towards sustainability. That&#8217;s exactly the time you scale your business and chase those herculean numbers.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how to do it.</p>
<h3><strong>1. Invest in Paid Advertising</strong></h3>
<p>The paid advertisement goes a long way, so use it as much as you can.</p>
<p>Social Media paid advertisement not only help you get clicks, but it increases the reachability of your business.</p>
<p>When you pay to advertise your content on social media, you are helped by the algorithms of these platforms. Facebook and Instagram, for instance, display your product to your targeted demographics.</p>
<p>For instance, Facebook alters its algorithms from time to time to scale out and provide relevant content to its users based on their searches. Consequently, the organic post reach for branded pages has decreased by 40%.</p>
<p>As per the statistics provided by AdWeek, the average branded Facebook post will only reach 2.6% of the brand’s targeted audience, which means that approximately 97% of the brand’s followers won’t see the brand’s posts.</p>
<p>And it’s not just limited to Facebook. Most of the social media platforms will limit or have limited the organic reach on their platform. Although some platforms still have exceptional potential, that may never unleash properly unless you invest in paid advertising for your SAAS business.</p>
<p>That’s exactly why a lot of big SAAS companies like Hubspot and Ahrefs still invest in paid ads for either their content or product’s direct promotion even though they already have big social media following.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21763" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/5.jpg" alt="Hubspot &amp; Ahrefs Investing in Paid Ads on Facebook" width="1365" height="1164" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/5.jpg 1365w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/5-300x256.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/5-768x655.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/5-1024x873.jpg 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/5-700x597.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1365px) 100vw, 1365px" />Here’s a list of platforms you can run ads on to target your customer for either brand awareness or conversions;</p>
<ul>
<li>Google Ads</li>
<li>LinkedIn Ads</li>
<li>Facebook Ads</li>
<li>Instagram Ads</li>
<li>Pinterest Ads</li>
<li>Twitter Ads</li>
</ul>
<p>When we talk about scaling through social media marketing, Facebook’s Pixel and Retargeting options can be massively helpful. In fact, we’ve recently delivered an <strong>800% Return-on-Investment</strong> and <strong>350% increase in revenue</strong> for a fitness clothing brand by deploying the same tactics.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/digital-marketing-for-clothing-brand-case-study/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>Case Study: Social Media Marketing for a Clothing Brand (350% More Revenue) </b></a></p>
<p>When done right, these tactics can bring significant results for SAAS companies too.</p>
<h3><strong>2. Promote Discount Offers Regularly</strong></h3>
<p>On your social media handles, give our discount offers and to gauge your community more, ascribe one day as a discount day.</p>
<p>Offer exclusive discounts on public holidays, like Thanksgiving, Christmas, and the New Year’s. To gauge more customers and identify potential users it bets if you offer a seven-day or a month-long free trial. Netflix has a free-trial option and about 47% of the users subscribed to one of the packages after their free trial ended.</p>
<p>Therefore, if the free trial marketing tool works for Netflix, you should try it too.</p>
<h3><strong>3. Invest in Viral Marketing</strong></h3>
<p>These days trends are mostly formed when things go viral and things go viral over social media all the time, whether it’s the Kiki Challenge or Baby shark, you too can have your SAAS product viral all over the internet.</p>
<p>Viral marketing relies solely on creativity. The concept must be as such that people are prompted to share it. The benefits of viral marketing are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>It increases your business reach.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If your business goes viral, it will reach EVERYWHERE. For viral marketing to work, people need access to the internet, which the majority of the people do across the globe. So, let’ say your viral campaign starts from Chicago, someone in New Zealand can see it and order it.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>It is extremely cheap.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You create the advertisement once and must wait for it to go viral, once its viral, you do not need to spend tons of money on it.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>It gives credibility to your business.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>When there is so much buzz about your business and everyone is talking (sharing) about it, people will assume that it&#8217;s genuine, which will give credibility to your business.</p>
<p>The question is how exactly a SAAS startup go for viral marketing? Creativity is the backbone of making something go viral. Let’s take the example of <strong><a href="https://www.hipchat.com/" class="broken_link">HipChat</a></strong> used to be software for one-on-one chatting, group chats, file storage, and video calling.</p>
<p>A few years back when they were just starting their marketing, they were short on budget and their CEO somehow got earned a cheap billboard ad at 101 North in the San Francisco Bay area for a few weeks. Knowing that he won’t get a chance of running a billboard ad this cheap ever again, he came up with an amazing idea that had the potential to go viral.</p>
<p>But why is a SAAS business investing in billboards in the first place? Well, it was an indirect way of promoting themselves on social media.</p>
<p>For the ad, HipChat’s CEO picked Rage comic’s Y-U-No guy and displayed a minimalistic advertisement only for a cost of 7K$.</p>
<p>The results?</p>
<p>Pictures of the billboard ad went extremely viral on platforms like Twitter &amp; Tumblr.</p>
<p>Their website search traffic increased by 300%</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21764" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/6.jpg" alt="Famous SAAS business, HipChat's Viral &quot;Y U No&quot; Meme Billboard ad " width="1365" height="1658" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/6.jpg 1365w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/6-247x300.jpg 247w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/6-768x933.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/6-843x1024.jpg 843w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/6-700x850.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1365px) 100vw, 1365px" /></p>

<h3><strong>4. Hire an Experienced Digital Agency</strong></h3>
<p>Digital agencies specialize in digital and <a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/social-media-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">social media marketing</a>. So, if your SAAS business is valuable to you, you must invest in a digital agency.</p>
<p>We understand that most people, especially start-ups find digital agencies extremely expensive, but in the long-run, they prove to be fruitful and your long-term return on investment (ROI) will be much higher than it would be without one.</p>
<p>Digital agencies know what they’re doing, and they are trained marketing professionals who know how, when and what to target to launch your SAAS business.</p>
<p>Now think of it this way, your idea will be mind-blowing, but of what use is it if doesn’t reap financial benefits for you, so to ensure the success of your business, you must hire a professional digital agency.</p>
<p>Before you hire a digital marketing agency, you should ask yourself the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>What are your company’s requirements?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You should ask yourself what you wish to have achieved from the marketing agency. Do you want to have a website designed or promote your product? Once you are clear about your aims, you can shortlist agencies that align with your objectives.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>How does the agency run its affairs?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If the agency can run its business effectively using the ‘right’ advertisement tools, it serves as the right sign for you to do business with them.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Has the agency worked with a SAAS business?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You will come across many digital marketing agencies, but very few of them have had SAAS businesses as their clients.</p>
<p>Therefore, when shortlisting a company, you must ensure that you choose a company that has worked with SAAS business in the past.</p>
<p>This will make things easier for you since their previous experience will help them devise an effective marketing strategy for your business and you won’t have to explain to them the nitty-gritty details of your requirements and expectations.</p>
