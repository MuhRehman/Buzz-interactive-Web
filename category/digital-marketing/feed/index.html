								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Website development and design practices have gone through a lot of changes in the way we see them today. Nowadays, developing a website is also a matter of being creative and trendy than just having the technical knowledge.</p>



<p>According to Netcraft’s web server survey in January 2019, there are over 1 billion websites on the World Wide Web. And this whopping number of websites is increasing every second.</p>



<p>This literally means that there is 1 website for every 7 people on the planet. And that’s already a lot of websites.</p>



<p>For this reason, there is growing need for applying different tactics and techniques so that your website can stand out among so many others. Today, businesses and individual website owners have to go a step further in making their websites more advanced and personalized to the audience they are trying to attract.</p>



<p>So talking about the upcoming future trends in web design and development industry in 2020, web developers are required to keep up with a myriad of technological as well as design related trends.</p>



<h1><strong>Progressive Web Apps</strong></h1>



<p>Progressive Web Applications or PWAs are increasingly becoming popular among web developers and users.</p>



<p>A Progressive Web App or PWA is an application software. Or you can simply put that a PWA is a website that gives the look and feel of a native mobile app.Popular examples of progressive web apps are: Uber, Pinterest, MakeMyTrip, Twitter Lite and others.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img class="wp-image-19892" src="https://static1.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/uber.jpg" alt="" width="565" height="376" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/uber.jpg 700w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/uber-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 565px) 100vw, 565px" />

</figure>
</div>



<p style="text-align: center;"> </p>



<p>Plus, you don’t necessarily have to download a PWA in your mobile phone &#8211; while you enjoy the ease of programming of a website. In PWAs, you get to access all the information and modern capabilities as you do in a mobile app.</p>



<p>Moreover, the modern features of PWAs are supported by majority of the web browsers. Meaning that every business can start to launch a website that’s smooth, swift, and app-like in its feel.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img class="wp-image-19893" src="https://static.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/starbucks-1024x1024.jpg" alt="" width="446" height="446" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/starbucks-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/starbucks-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/starbucks-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/starbucks-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/starbucks-570x570.jpg 570w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/starbucks-500x500.jpg 500w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/starbucks-1000x1000.jpg 1000w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/starbucks-700x700.jpg 700w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/starbucks.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 446px) 100vw, 446px" />

</div>



<p style="text-align: center;"> </p>



<p>For these reasons, <a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/web-development-services/">PWA web development</a> is going to remain a popular choice in 2020 and beyond.</p>



<p>It’s important to state here that most of the well-known companies have experienced a significant growth in their user engagement. And increase in user engagement gave them high conversion rates upon using PWAs.</p>



<p>Take the example of <strong>Twitter Lite</strong> as a good case in point. Twitter had realized that they needed an app that worked on every device, and loaded quickly. As it had to engage a whopping 380 million audience at that time, Twitter introduced its PWA version in the form of Twitter Lite.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img class="wp-image-19930" src="https://static2.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/twitter-mobile.jpg" alt="Twitter mobile" width="566" height="377" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/twitter-mobile.jpg 623w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/twitter-mobile-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 566px) 100vw, 566px" />
<figcaption><br />Image Credit: Twitter Lite</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>



<p style="text-align: center;"> </p>



<p>The results achieved were incredible! Twitter experienced:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>★ 65% increase in pages per session</p>
<p>★ 75% increase in Tweets sent</p>
<p>★ And a 20% decrease in bounce rates</p>
</blockquote>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<h3> </h3>



<h3><strong>Benefits</strong></h3>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>➝ <strong>App-like experience:</strong> Makes easy for your users to access your content &#8211; so they keep coming back.</p>
<p>➝ <strong>Faster loading time:</strong> Decreases the bounce rate (users clicking away from website after viewing only one page).</p>
<p>➝ <strong>Better UX:</strong> Engages users, which allows them to stay on your website for long.</p>
<p>➝ <strong>Lesser consumption:</strong> Internet data is consumed less.</p>
<p>➝ <strong>Increased Sales:</strong> Happy and engaged users increase conversion rates.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>UX Design</strong></h3>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Talking about a <a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/design-services/">UX design website</a>, there is cut-throat competition among websites in the online world. User experience or UX refers to the overall experience of a user looking at your website in terms of how easy and pleasing it is to use.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-19895" src="https://static3.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ux-design.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ux-design.jpg 600w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ux-design-300x150.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" />

</figure>
</div>



<p style="text-align: center;"> </p>



<p>But why are UX design best practices becoming so much of a grave concern for almost every website owner?</p>



<p>It’s because users these days are super impatient in their online behaviour. A user today, according to <a href="https://allisonjedwards.com/the-attention-span-crisis-and-what-it-means-for-kids/" rel="nofollow">research</a>, can focus on a web page for just 8 seconds. This raises the chance of more users clicking away if you are not optimizing your UX design.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img class="wp-image-19896" src="https://static2.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/human.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="469" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/human.jpg 712w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/human-300x281.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/human-700x657.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></figure>
</div>



<p>So the more your website page visuals and style click the minds of the users, the more they enjoy checking it out.</p>



<p>A lot more focus will be on making the UX design more relevant to the taste of target audience in 2020. So that it reduces friction, and saves time of users.</p>



<p>Some important UX design best practices you should consider include:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>★ Personalize website according to your target audience.</p>
<p>★ Light popups suggesting tips to users to speed up their action taking.</p>
<p>★ Features should be visible only when a user needs to see them in a specific context.</p>
<p>★ Simple changes like placement of navigation bar, non-irritating presentation of adverts, and avoidance of distracting popups can work wonders.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Benefits</strong></h3>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>➝ <strong>Increase in Revenue:</strong>  75% of people think of a website based on its overall aesthetics. Organically increasing the engagement of users through awesome UX design is a good way of ensuring long-term increase in sales. Rather than depending on just advertising for boosting short term sales.</p>
<p>➝ <strong>Low Costs:</strong> Applying UX design approach in website development cuts a lot of costs.</p>
<p>➝ <strong>UX Design Increases Customer Loyalty:</strong> Positively engaging experiences bind users to your product. This keeps them coming back for more.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Chatbots</strong></h2>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Chatbots are empowered through Artificial Intelligence (AI). They simply help users to share their queries which they otherwise would enquire from a human customer service representative.</p>



<p>While the owner is away taking care of other things, AI helps bots solve problems and interact in a human like style with customers.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img class="wp-image-19898" src="https://static2.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/chatbox.png" alt="" width="463" height="400" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/chatbox.png 832w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/chatbox-300x260.png 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/chatbox-768x665.png 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/chatbox-700x606.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 463px) 100vw, 463px" /></figure>
</div>



<p>Due to its popularity and acceptance among internet users, more and more companies are opting for interactive chatbots on their websites. This demand for AI powered technology performing multitasking will see a rapid increase throughout 2020.</p>



<p>Furthermore, big companies are making financial investments to enable AI bots with complex thinking and negotiation capacity like that of humans. These AI chatbots now seem to take over the messaging industry with their multipurpose role capabilities.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image">

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote is-style-default" style="border-color: #abb8c3;">
<blockquote>
<p>“Google analysts also believe that next year, 2020, robots will be smart enough so that mimic complex behavior of humans like flirting and jokes”</p>
<cite> (Source: Accenture)</cite></blockquote>
</figure>



<h3><strong>Benefits</strong></h3>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>➝ <strong>Accessible anytime: </strong>People spend around 7 minutes until they are assigned to a CSR. Chatbots are replacing slower communication methods like emails, phone calls and live chat.</p>
<p>➝ <strong>Handling capacity:</strong> can communicate with thousands of humans at the same time.</p>
<p>➝ <strong>Satisfied Customers:</strong> Chatbots are not prone to emotions like human beings. They follow only what they are programmed to do. Bots also retain the user’s order history like address, name, number and other preferences &#8211; making transactions very simple and fast.</p>
<p>➝ <strong>Cost effectivity:</strong> You don’t have to pay a salary to a chatbot.</p>
<p>➝ <strong>Customer Data Recording:</strong> Bots are able to record consumer behaviour and their purchasing patterns. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ajagrawal/2016/07/13/7-ways-chatbot-tools-are-important-for-marketing/#3c4b4230602e">Forbes</a> says that this capacity helps any company to decide “which products to market differently, which to market more and which to redevelop for relaunch”. In this way, more personalized services to the consumer are achieved.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Minimalist Approach to Web Design</strong></h3>



<p>Another growing trend in web development is the need to prefer simplicity over visual splendour.</p>



<p>Neatly designed websites tend to gather more user appeal. So the practice of complimenting high quality visuals with minimalism and clean-design solutions is a great way of growing user appeal. It’s better if you hire a professional <a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/web-development-services/">web design and development company</a> that fully caters to all your business’s requisite needs.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img class="wp-image-19900" src="https://static.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/nerds-1024x497.jpg" alt="" width="549" height="266" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/nerds-1024x497.jpg 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/nerds-300x146.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/nerds-768x373.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/nerds-700x340.jpg 700w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/nerds.jpg 1347w" sizes="(max-width: 549px) 100vw, 549px" />
<figcaption>Image Credit: <a href="https://nerds.company/">Nerds</a></figcaption>
</figure>
</div>



<p>Further focus is on writing personalized and simple worded content that engages users into exploring more about your brand.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img class="wp-image-19914" src="https://static3.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/the-law-practice.png" alt="new law practice" width="616" height="276" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/the-law-practice.png 697w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/the-law-practice-300x135.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 616px) 100vw, 616px" /></figure>
</div>



<p>This practice was started by the Microsoft Corporation in its OS development preferences. Where Microsoft began creating easy to navigate UIs (user interface) and proper placement of touchscreen ready elements.</p>



<h3><strong>Benefits</strong></h3>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>➝ <strong>Ranking &amp; Traffic:</strong> Google and other search engines rank your website to a higher position. And with better ranking and a neat website, you will get more and more traffic and leads.</p>
<p>➝ <strong>Loading Span: </strong>Web page loading speed is accelerated.</p>
<p>➝ <strong>Less Burdenizing:</strong> Clean UI and navigation lower CPU’s requirements and lower the bandwidth too.</p>
<p>➝ <strong>User engagement:</strong> Better accessibility will let more users to be engaged on your website. Web</p>
</blockquote>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Single Page Applications</strong></h3>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p>A Single Page Application is a website that fits on a single page. The main goal of sticking to a single page style is to make the user experience effortlessly smooth.</p>



<p>Having said that, the old way of surfing a website’s pages is slow. It’s that whenever you want to go to a certain web page on the browser, each page takes time to separately load and then shows up.</p>



<p>Conversely, what SPAs do is that they instantly download all the web pages at the backend in the form of a file. In this way, SPAs save you from reloading any pages. As a result, scrolling through many pages becomes a matter of seconds for users.</p>



<p>The inconvenience of long page loading time is now being replaced by a growing trend in the development of SPAs in web development.</p>



<p>Because they are fast and easy to navigate, more companies are joining the race to create better SPA style websites for their users.</p>



<p>And so the SPAs here to stay in 2020 and beyond.</p>



<p>Remarkable examples of popular SPAs include:</p>



<p>Gmail …</p>



<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img class="wp-image-19911" src="https://static3.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/new-gmail-1024x495.png" alt="New gmail" width="604" height="291" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/new-gmail-1024x495.png 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/new-gmail-300x145.png 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/new-gmail-768x371.png 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/new-gmail-700x338.png 700w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/new-gmail.png 1202w" sizes="(max-width: 604px) 100vw, 604px" /></figure>

<p>Twitter …</p>



<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>And others.</p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Benefits</strong></h3>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>➝ <strong>Fast &amp; Swift:</strong> No need to reload pages again and again.</p>
<p>➝ <strong>User Friendly Readability:</strong> SPAs have designs that visually appeal to the sight. More appeal means increased conversion rates. When you better engage users, they always return to your website and are likely to purchase a product/service.</p>
<p>➝ <strong>Cost Effective:</strong> They are relatively cheap to develop and easy to set.</p>
<p>➝ <strong>High Performance:</strong> The overall performance is always better as less bandwidth is required by SPAs.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>AI Content Curation</strong></h3>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p>The true merit of a website is measured by its content. This fact cannot be emphasized enough.</p>



<p>Content is simply “the king” in user engagement.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img class="wp-image-19905" src="https://static.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/triberr-1024x575.jpg" alt="" width="563" height="315" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/triberr-1024x575.jpg 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/triberr-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/triberr-700x393.jpg 700w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/triberr-539x303.jpg 539w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/triberr.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 563px) 100vw, 563px" />
<figcaption>Image Credit: <a href="https://blog.triberr.com/">triberr</a></figcaption>
</figure>
</div>



<p style="text-align: center;"> </p>



<p>Artificial Intelligence based content curation rules the roost in the upcoming future. AI algorithms will soon take over the process of content curation just as AI chatbots look after human queries.</p>



<p>So how will this happen?</p>



<p>An example can that be of a professional painter. While surfing the web, a painter won’t necessarily be interested in a lifestyle blog or an SEO blog, right? In such situations, AI will automatically be triggered to place painting related content on the forefront.</p>



<p>Websites will thus be developed and optimized in such a way in 2020 and beyond for more intelligent responses.</p>



<p>Moreover, users can also opt-out of these settings to have a more hands-on approach for filtering their content.</p>



<h3><strong>Benefits</strong></h3>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>➝ Automatic content selection and generation meaning better matched content for user.</p>
<p>➝ Easier time for users in finding relevant content..</p>
<p>➝ Personalized content for chatbots.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Motion UI</strong></h3>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p>If they say a picture is worth a thousand words. Then how would it be like if a picture moved and transitioned too? Motion UI technology allows you to do just that!</p>



<p>In simple words, a motion UI is a combination of transitioning pieces of animation to make things appear on a website as if they are moving. Developers are now focusing on motion UI for developing websites to make them look more appealing to the users.</p>



<p>Motion UI will soon be a high in demand web development trend because of its:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>★ High potential of usability</p>
<p>★ Modern animations</p>
<p>★ Dynamic visual graphics</p>
<p>★ The storytelling style of presentation</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It allows developers to use a wide range of tools and techniques. So that they can better engage target audience’s attention. Research claims that the average time span of human attention is even less than that of a goldfish.</p>



<p>That being said, today’s users have gotten super bored with hundreds and thousands of similar looking websites on the internet. Old static designs don’t visually appeal to their senses as much as they did in the year 2000 since attention spans are suffering.</p>



<p>That is where motion web UI comes into play. Motion UI’s captivating visuals are an awesome way of getting users to not get bored and pay attention.</p>



<p>Now if you’re successful in getting the user’s attention through motion UI, you can further engage them with your content. So you can turn these engaged users into qualified quality leads for your business.</p>



<h3><strong>Benefits</strong></h3>



<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>➝ <strong>Always Fresh:</strong> Your site will never look old as designs get easily updated.</p>

<p>➝ <strong>Lively Impression:</strong> A huge variety of innovative tactics can be applied that engage you more users.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Internet Of Things</strong></h3>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p>The term IoT or Internet of Things refers to all the electronic devices as a whole that can connect to the internet. Meaning any device that is connectable to the internet will fall in the IoT category.</p>

<p>IoT has applications in health care, smart cities, agriculture, wearable’s, smart home appliances with many other possibilities.</p>



<p>Now you must be wondering what IoT has to do with website development? Let me explain:</p>



<p>A lot of Internet of Things devices can display website content on them. Popular examples include smart appliances, UI on TVs, laptops, industrial monitors, smart speakers, smart phones, smart watches and glasses, and so forth.</p>



<p>Moreover, the devices in IoT are connected to one another via the internet, and work with huge amounts of data. IoT web development is therefore different from ordinary web development as it puts more focus on system’s scalability and reliability.</p>



<p>More and more new and diverse devices with web display capability are being developed. Therefore IoT will undeniably be an essential part of web development in 2020 and beyond.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the name suggests, <em>digital </em>marketing is all about automation &#8211; and the art of getting more done with less <em>effort</em>.</p>
<p>In other words, using intuitive automation tools such as chatbots to work smart, with speed, and deliver greater efficiency. At this point, it&#8217;s natural to wonder &#8211; &#8220;<em>Why chatbots?&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Good question.</p>
<p>First off, data suggests that <em>&#8220;Around </em><a href="https://www.smallbizgenius.net/by-the-numbers/chatbot-statistics/#gref"><em>1.4 billion </em></a><em>people are already using chatbots.&#8221; </em>All in all, chatbots are becoming ubiquitous.</p>
<p>Two, IBM claims that chatbots have the capability to answer as much as <a href="https://www.smallbizgenius.net/by-the-numbers/chatbot-statistics/#gref">80%</a> of the standard questions. Basically, that if trained right, chatbots can offer error-free results at lightspeed.</p>
<p>Three, there&#8217;s growing acceptance amongst businesses, sectors, and industries for adopting chatbots. Further research suggests that a staggering &#8220;<a href="https://www.smallbizgenius.net/by-the-numbers/chatbot-statistics/#gref"><em>$5 billion</em></a><em> will be invested in chatbots by 2021.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Long story short, chatbots are the future of <a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">digital marketing services</a>, and the future is now.</p>
<p>In this blog, we will look at the top-10 ways in which you can use chatbots to advance and enhance your digital marketing strategy. Let&#8217;s get started.</p>
<h2><strong>Top-10 Applications of Chatbot in Digital Marketing &#8211; Coupled with Real-World Examples</strong></h2>
<h3><strong style="font-size: 16px;">1. Connect with your Website Visitors</strong></h3>
<p>With nearly every business going online, owing to the global pandemic, this particular use-case comes in handy. Your customers today shop differently, on diverse platforms, and around-the-clock.</p>
<p>You can think of <a href="https://acquire.io/chatbot/">chatbots</a> as every customer&#8217;s personal virtual guide &#8212; ever-ready to answer customer queries and offer customized help:<a href="https://sumo.com/stories/ecommerce-chatbot-marketing"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-21816 size-full" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/12.jpg" alt="How chatbots connect with website visitors" width="837" height="648" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/12.jpg 837w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/12-300x232.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/12-768x595.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/12-700x542.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 837px) 100vw, 837px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://sumo.com/stories/ecommerce-chatbot-marketing">Image Source</a></p>
<p>Additionally, bots are extremely capable of answering routine questions and handling basic requests that do not require human effort or intervention. As you can imagine, this helps take some of the workload off of your already-overwhelmed CX, sales, and digital teams. As per data:</p>
<p>&#8220;<a href="https://www.smallbizgenius.net/by-the-numbers/chatbot-statistics/#gref">64% </a>of agents who use Chabot’s are free to spend their time solving more difficult and complex problems.&#8221; &#8211; SalesForce</p>
<p><strong><em>Key takeaway</em></strong><em>: The bots of today have evolved into smart and efficient online &#8216;agents&#8217; that can emulate conversations between live agents and customers. So make sure to keep this in mind when building your bot&#8217;s personality, tone, and style. Typically, bots that are warm, friendly, and helpful are the ones that get most of the traction. In short, chatbots delivering one-word robotic answers is a thing of the past. </em></p>
<h3><strong>2. Qualify and Nurture Leads</strong></h3>
<p>Whether your business is just starting out or whether it&#8217;s well-established, lead management can be a tiring and exhaustive process. You&#8217;ll be surprised to know that bots can lend a helping hand in capturing and nurturing leads. This can be done by programming them to help understand where your customers are in the sales funnel via a set of questions.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Here&#8217;s a useful example of how a Chabot helps nurture leads, particularly at odd times in a day:<a href="https://hybrid.chat/blog/chatbot-use-cases-what-bots-can-do-in-different-industries/"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-21817" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2-3.jpg" alt="Chatbots Qualify and Nurture Leads" width="580" height="636" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2-3.jpg 661w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2-3-274x300.jpg 274w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" /></a><strong><a href="https://hybrid.chat/blog/chatbot-use-cases-what-bots-can-do-in-different-industries/">Image Source</a></strong></p>
<p>So even if your customer service team is offline, none of your leads will go unnoticed or unanswered as the bot is available 24x7x365 to capture all important information (think: contact, email ID, name, etc.), find the right product/service for your customers, and contribute to <a href="https://outfunnel.com/b2b-lead-generation-ideas/">lead generation</a> round-the-clock.</p>
<p><strong><em>Key takeaway:</em></strong><em> Chatbots are capable of handling all the &#8216;grunt&#8217; work when it comes to lead generation &#8211; starting with capturing leads that land up on your website. That said, it is best to use live agents in conjunction with chatbots who can &#8216;close the deal&#8217; while the bots work on getting leads in the first place.   </em></p>
<h3><strong>3. Improve Team Performance &#8211; Especially with Remote Work</strong></h3>
<p>Remote work is on the rise, and teams are struggling to keep up as they continue to work-from-home. It has been seen that one of the major contributors to low productivity is unorganized, messy management. This is where bots can help.</p>
<p>They can assist your teams to stay accountable and in sync by automating and simplifying the organization process. As with customers, bots can ask employees a bunch of routine questions such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Which goals did you accomplish yesterday? </em></li>
<li><em>What projects and tasks are you working on today? </em></li>
<li><em>What kind of issues/challenges are you facing?</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Once the bot gathers all the important information, it organizes it and makes it &#8216;available&#8217; in a centralized place where team members can access it at the click of a button.</p>
<p><strong><em>Key takeaway:</em></strong><em> Organizational bots help enhance team performance in addition to delivering a host of benefits such as making teams accountable, helping them to stay on top of their goals, and eliminating any roadblocks by empowering teams to always stay in sync.</em></p>
<h3><strong>4. Customize the User Experience</strong></h3>
<p>A personalized experience is a coveted competitive differentiator for brands &#8211; big or small. The customers love it, with over <a href="https://www.marketingdive.com/news/study-71-of-consumers-prefer-personalized-ads/418831/">71%</a> of them preferring personalized ads. In fact, personalization is not just restricted to ads. Customers love personalized suggestions by brands and don&#8217;t mind sharing information if that guarantees them a more tailor-made experience that better suits their needs.</p>
<p>Bots can help customize the customer experience by asking a series of logical and sequential questions and gathering customer inputs so that they can offer relevant suggestions:</p>
<p>An excellent example of bot-led customization is CNN&#8217;s bot, which rolls out personalized news feeds to readers based on lists of predefined options:</p>
<p><a href="https://neilpatel.com/blog/bots-digital-marketing-strategy/"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-21826 size-full" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/10.jpg" alt="Chatbots Customize the User Experience" width="1224" height="648" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/10.jpg 1224w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/10-300x159.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/10-768x407.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/10-1024x542.jpg 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/10-700x371.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1224px) 100vw, 1224px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><a href="https://neilpatel.com/blog/bots-digital-marketing-strategy/">Image Source</a></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Key takeaway:</em></strong><em> Numerous brands across the board today are making use of chatbots to gather critical data about the users so that they can offer a more relevant and personalized user experience. This sits well with the well-informed customers of today who are constantly looking for brands that can truly &#8216;understand&#8217; them &#8211; both literally and figuratively.</em></p>
<h3><strong>5. Combine the Power of Bots &amp; Instant Messaging &#8211; All Hail Facebook Messenger Bots</strong></h3>
<p>Did you know that<em> &#8220;There are over </em><a href="https://www.crowdspring.com/blog/facebook-messenger-marketing-guide/#:~:text=A%20Facebook%20Messenger%20chatbot%20or,active%20chatbots%20on%20Facebook%20Messenger."><em>300,000 </em></a><em>active chatbots on Facebook Messenger?&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Clearly, chatbots have made their way onto popular social media platforms and messaging apps such as Facebook, Slack, etc.</p>
<p>The real question then becomes &#8211; what&#8217;s led to this skyrocketing growth?</p>
<p>As per data by Facebook:</p>
<p>On the consumer side, over 59% of millennials and 60% of Gen Xers in the U.S. have interacted with chatbots. And according to a Facebook survey, more than half (53%) of customers say they’re more likely to shop with a business that they can connect with via chat.</p>
<p>Nearly <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/490424/number-of-worldwide-facebook-users/">one-fourth</a> of the world&#8217;s population is on Facebook, and as we saw, &#8216;messaging&#8217; has become second-nature to people of all generations.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Most eCommerce stores use Facebook Messenger bots to interact with customers and drive sales:<a href="https://neilpatel.com/blog/bots-digital-marketing-strategy/"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-21819" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/8.jpg" alt="Power of ChatBots &amp; Instant Messaging in Digital Marketing" width="580" height="636" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/8.jpg 661w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/8-274x300.jpg 274w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" /></a> <strong><a href="https://neilpatel.com/blog/bots-digital-marketing-strategy/">Image Source</a></strong></p>
<p>Hence, brands need to capitalize on this feature and communicate with customers on the latter&#8217;s preferred platform of choice. Additionally, bots can also assist your customers as well as employees should they get stuck while browsing through your social media pages.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Here&#8217;s another example of a witty and humorous Facebook Messenger Chabot for inspiration:<a href="https://medium.com/marketing-and-entrepreneurship/12-ready-made-facebook-messenger-chatbots-you-can-clone-today-a5e91a0060e"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-21820" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/9.jpg" alt="Power of Bots &amp; Instant Facebook Messages" width="580" height="636" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/9.jpg 661w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/9-274x300.jpg 274w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" /></a><strong><a href="https://medium.com/marketing-and-entrepreneurship/12-ready-made-facebook-messenger-chatbots-you-can-clone-today-a5e91a0060e">Image Source</a></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Key takeaway:</em></strong><em> Messaging platforms and chatbots are a match made in heaven. You can use Slack bots for demonstrating fun, more casual, and interactive content such as &#8220;behind the scenes of your organization,&#8221; while you can leverage Facebook Messenger bots to boost your leads.</em></p>
<h3><strong>6. Get to Know Your Customers Better</strong></h3>
<p>Going back to the basics, chatbots can be used to understand your customer&#8217;s demographics, behavioral patterns, shopping habits, preferences, and pain-points, among other things. After all, you can&#8217;t really create an impactful digital marketing strategy if you&#8217;re shooting blind.</p>
<p>By asking user-friendly and simple questions, the bot captures useful information. From the customer&#8217;s standpoint, it acts as a convenient way to gather data as the users don&#8217;t need to fill lengthy surveys or divulge useless information:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://botscrew.com/blog/facebook-ads-chatbots/"><strong><img class="aligncenter wp-image-21821" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/5-1.jpg" alt="Chatbots help you get to Know Your Customers Better" width="580" height="636" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/5-1.jpg 661w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/5-1-274x300.jpg 274w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" />Image Source</strong></a></p>
<p>Based on the information gathered, it can offer helpful tips and relevant suggestions, thereby enhancing the overall user experience and making it more positive throughout the customer&#8217;s life cycle.</p>
<h3><strong>7. Gather &amp; Analyze Useful Customer Feedback</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Every campaign or strategy is incomplete without measuring its effectiveness. One of the most effective ways to gauge its failure or success is by gathering user feedback, as shown below:<u><a href="https://surveybot.io/"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-21822" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/6-2.jpg" alt="Chatbots Analyze Customer Feedback" width="580" height="636" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/6-2.jpg 661w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/6-2-274x300.jpg 274w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" /></a></u></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><u><strong><a href="https://surveybot.io/">Image Source</a></strong></u></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><em>Key takeaway:</em></strong><em> All in all, chatbots are a seamless way to conduct customer-centric surveys, requiring minimal effort from the latter &#8211; a big plus, if you ask us. Plus, chatbots can engage with customers in a more informal and fun capacity by using GIFs, images, videos, etc. (as opposed to the boring, lengthy, and dull survey forms), thereby boosting customer engagement and encouraging more customers to participate in surveys.</em></p>
<h3><strong>8. Build a Knowledge Base &amp; Drive Rich Leads to Your  Assets</strong></h3>
<p>Circling back to the point of qualifying and nurturing leads, Chatbots also drives traffic to your website and other platforms by acting as a rich repository of the knowledge base. Take the following example:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/10/04/chatbots"><strong><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21823" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/7-1.jpg" alt="Chatbots Build a Knowledge Base &amp; Drive Quality" width="1224" height="648" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/7-1.jpg 1224w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/7-1-300x159.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/7-1-768x407.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/7-1-1024x542.jpg 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/7-1-700x371.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1224px) 100vw, 1224px" />Image Source</strong></a></p>
<p>In order to capture potential leads, the bot can offer in-depth and useful articles in exchange for their email IDs. The central idea is to converse with users in a thoughtful and engaging manner while boosting conversions and storing accurate information.</p>
<h3><strong>9. Up-Sell, Down-Sell, and Cross-Sell with Powerful Offers</strong></h3>
<p>&#8220;More than 70% of customers are interested in hearing from retailers after they make a purchase, especially if they provide personalized content.&#8221; &#8211; <a href="https://hbr.org/2016/05/online-retailers-should-care-more-about-the-post-purchase-experience">Harvard Business Review</a></p>
<p>Acquiring new customers is great, but retaining old ones is even better. So, if you wish to keep your loyal customers motivated and engaged, you can leverage the power of chatbots and offer deals, discounts, and incentives based on your customer&#8217;s shopping history</p>
<p>Additionally, bots can introduce customers to interesting upsell/down-sell offers and boost sales in the process:<img class="aligncenter wp-image-21824" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1-2.jpg" alt="Up-Sell, Down-Sell, and Cross-Sell with chatbots" width="580" height="636" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1-2.jpg 661w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1-2-274x300.jpg 274w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><a href="https://www.getjenny.com/blog/chatbot-use-cases-25-real-life-examples">Image Source</a></strong></p>
<p>In fact, one of the most brilliant examples of tracking the effectiveness of your promotional campaigns is using chatbot-exclusive discount codes (in this case &#8211; FRESHBOT25.)</p>
<p>As more and more customers download the app and use the code, the bot can track the number of customers that are coming in through the chatbot and analyze the campaign&#8217;s effectiveness.</p>
<h3><strong>10. Enhance the Overall Customer Experience </strong></h3>
<p>As we saw, chatbots can be used in varying capacities &#8211; from being a virtual Sales Assistant and onboarding products to assisting customers by showing demos and taking them on virtual tours of products/services, there&#8217;s much you can do.</p>
<p>Chatbots are increasingly becoming smarter and more conversational in nature, making the customer experience more detailed and positive.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not all. Chatbots can be equipped and trained to roll out interesting contests, quizzes, and giveaways periodically so that customers genuinely look forward to engaging with your brand across diverse touch-points.</p>
<h2><strong>Way Forward</strong></h2>
<p>&#8220;<a href="https://www.smallbizgenius.net/by-the-numbers/chatbot-statistics/#gref">85%</a> of customer interactions will be handled without human agents by 2021.&#8221; Chatbots Life</p>
<p>To wrap up, chatbots can be thought of as useful multi-tasking tools that can help you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Connect with your website visitors</li>
<li>Qualify and nurture leads</li>
<li>Improve the overall team performance</li>
<li>Personalize the customer experience</li>
<li>Interact with customers on popular platforms and enhance <a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/social-media-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">social media marketing</a></li>
<li>Get to know your customers better</li>
<li>Gather and analyze useful customer reviews</li>
<li>Build a knowledge base and drive rich leads to your resource assets</li>
<li>Up-sell, down-sell, and cross-sell with powerful deals and offers</li>
<li>Enhance the overall customer experience</li>
</ul>
<p>So, go back to the drawing board if you need to and take a hard look at your digital marketing strategy to see where you can leverage the multi-functional benefits of a chatbot and boost brand loyalty as well as customer happiness, one interaction at a time.</p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the current onslaught of a huge chunk of internet users seeking fast, convenient and cost-effective services online &#8211; on-demand service is becoming more of a buzzword nowadays. The utility of on-demand service apps is simply undeniable because of the quality services they ensure.</p>
<p>Quality and shorter delivery time are in fact the main reasons why some of the on-demand apps have gathered immense popularity across the globe.</p>
<p>If you’re looking to launch an on-demand application service app &#8211; right now is a better time! In this blog, we’ll get to explore the types; recent trends; evolving opportunities; the business how to approach; and the growing importance of on-demand application builder community.</p>
<h2><strong>What On-Demand Service Apps are?</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It literally means a middle party software that acts as a source of connection between customers and service providers. On-demand services in simple words &#8211; facilitate communication &#8211; in audible, visual or textual forms &#8211; to get jobs done successfully.</p>
<p>Popular examples are Uber for taxis, Zomato for food, and Airbnb for hotels etc.</p>
<p>On-demand service platforms allow users to solve their daily problems. And in return, users are increasingly happy to pay for the services they get online. In this way, companies or on demand service providers grow their business reach and sales, and their customers find a convenient way of getting those services.</p>
<h3><strong>Why people use on demand delivery apps and what do they do on it:</strong></h3>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Reason for the popularity of these apps is the ‘instant problem solving value’ users get. So how do on-demand services actually turn inconveniences into solutions in just a few taps?</p>
<ul>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">“Oh no! I’ll be late, as it’s gonna take long for me to reach the bus stop. How about calling an Uber taxi to my current location &#8211; that’ll save me the time and effort”.</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">If I just order pizzas via Zomato app &#8211; I’ll be able to spend my full time with guests who have arrived already”.</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">“Now my inflexible job hours won’t hinder me from getting my father a regular medical check-up with Doctor on Demand app”.</li>
</ul>
<p>Above are just a few daily-life scenarios to quote.</p>
<p>Apart from getting the service, users also:</p>
<ul>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">Pay for services in the apps</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">Get real time notifications of service provider’s GPS location, time required, and audible, textual or even video communication and vice versa.</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">70% of the users use on-demand platforms to search for hiring services online, while 62% of them use on-demand apps to check the live status of the service they’ve ordered.</li>
</ul>
<h3></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Types and Nature of On-Demand Service Apps:</strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We can distinguish on-demand delivery apps into three forms depending on the nature of people involved:</p>
<ul>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">P2P (Person To Person): These on-demand service platforms allow individual users to exchange products with users.</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">Examples: Olx and eBay</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">B2B (Business To Business): These on-demand delivery apps are solely for supporting communication and service exchange between businesses.</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">Examples: Cargomatic and Catalant</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">B2P (Business To Person): B2P or B2C on-demand delivery apps facilitate services and products delivery from companies to customers. Meaning companies direct their employees to reach out and provide products and services to its customers and make money with it.</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">Examples: Uber and Booking.com</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>How Do On-Demand Service Apps Work? General Steps:</strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1- User places a request.</p>
<p>2- A service provider sees the request.</p>
<p>3- Provider accepts or declines the request (depending on the situation).</p>
<p>4- System shows payment for authorization.</p>
<p>5- Provider delivers the service or product after payment authorization.</p>
<p>6- Customer confirms the service delivery.</p>
<p>7- Payment then gets deducted.</p>

<h4><strong>Some Real Life Examples of Highly Successful On-demand Delivery Platforms and How They’re Influencing Major Industries:</strong></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Taxi Service</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>On <u>UBER</u><strong>, </strong>people can now request rides from any location on their smartphones and track the nearest available rides to go anywhere.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Food Delivery</strong></li>

<p>Apps like <u>Zomato</u> have made ordering, real time tracking and delivery of food a matter of several minutes  without the fatigue of actually going to a  takeaway.</p>

</ul>
<p>With apps like <u>Doctor On Demand</u>, now there is less danger of not successfully tackling an emergency situation when any patient needs a doctor.</p>
<ul>

<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-19785 size-large" src="https://static.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/logos-1024x631.jpg" alt="Companies-Logo" width="1024" height="631" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/logos-1024x631.jpg 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/logos-300x185.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/logos-768x473.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/logos-700x431.jpg 700w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/logos.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Other big on-services industries include <u>fitness</u>, <u>maintenance</u>, <u>laundry</u>, <u>beauty &amp; Hair salon</u>, <u>pet care</u>, and the list continues.</p>
<h3><strong>Notable Statistical Trends In the On-demand Economy:</strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Annual Spending: </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>According to data collected by NTRS (National Technology Readiness Survey), the year 2017 saw an increase at a whopping 58% ($75.7) in total spending for on-demand (products and services) as compared to 2016.</p>
<p>These numbers are significantly growing for the market of on-demand apps in 2019 too &#8211; and are reported to reach a huge collective value of $335Billion by 2025 &#8211; according to PwC’s latest research.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>So are on-demand services gathering significant following?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The answer is a big YES. In America alone, around 7.6M Americans shall become providers of on-demand services.</p>
<p>Moreover, on-demand customers reached from 24.9 million in 2016 to 41.5 million in 2017. It’s surprising to see that more than 2 billion people used cellular devices to make a purchase worldwide &#8211; by the end of 2017.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Who are using on-demand platforms?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Millennials form the lion’s share of on-demand service seekers at 49%, whereas people between the ages of 35 to 54 make up 30% of the consumer quota.</p>
<h3><strong>Booming Importance of On-Demand App Developing Community</strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So what really makes the role of an on-demand app and <a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/web-development-services/">web development company</a> to gain so much importance in the world of app development? Well arguably it’s their different or rather specialized skill-set that’s crucial for developing on-demand service and delivery apps.</p>
<p>On-demand App creation is harder than creating a regular mobile app.</p>
<p>The maxim “necessity is the mother of invention” holds perfectly with how the on-demand market is growing so fast &#8211; and how businesses are finding more ways to deliver on-demand services.</p>
<p>In this scenario, it’s expected that the demand of programmers that specialize in Uber-like app creation &#8211; shall continue to rise.</p>
<h3><strong>How On-Demand Apps Benefit Different Groups:</strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Youth:</strong></p>
<p>The young generation is realizing how on-demand services provenly save a lot of time &#8211; while leaving ample room for getting other important things done &#8211; that ultimately have a direct effect on the quality of their lives. This on-demand trend is now seen by a lot of users as a way of uplifting their economic status.</p>
<p><strong>Businessmen / App Service Providers:</strong></p>
<p>51% of on-demand app providers shared that their financial situation has improved as compared to the last year 2018 (Burson Marsteller Survey) &#8211; while 64% expect the same &#8211; for the next year 2020.</p>
<p><strong>Employees:</strong></p>
<p>There has been a steady growth in the number of workers entering the stream of on-demand economy &#8211; every year. As of 2017 &#8211; up to 5.4 million employees were working in the on-demand market on record. This upward trend will absolutely hold strong in future.</p>
<p><strong>Skilled Workers:</strong></p>
<p>There’s going to be a high trend of more high skilled positions in the on-demand apps services. Take the health and medicine industry for example  &#8211; the on-demand nursing app named FRND developed to facilitate services of a certified nurse at home &#8211; who handles a wide range of specialized healthcare needs, is one example of a skill oriented on-demand job. So in the near future &#8211; as the on-demand economy enters more diverse industries &#8211; highly skilled positions will be in vogue.</p>
<p><strong>Is the On-demand Service Platform Worth Investing In:</strong></p>
<p>Absolutely yes! Reason being is that on-demand service is a game of providing the “value of convenience” to a population. Uber and Airbnb are superb examples of how these problem-solving on-demand service apps made things convenient for people &#8211; and speedily joined amongst the most widely used apps internationally.</p>
<p>Investment rounds focused on funding on-demand startups that started in 2014 ended with a figure of $74 billion and $102 Billion in the last quarter of 2017. Given the popularity, we can expect those numbers to keep growing significantly in 2019 and beyond.</p>
<p>Previously shared statistics speak volumes of the profit potential that the on-demand economy has. It only requires the research to understand the routine needs of people that can conveniently be fulfilled through an on-demand platform. And then of course &#8211; a team of professional developers from a <a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/">creative agency</a> along with investments to back the program.</p>
<h2><strong>Now If You’ve Decided To Make an On-demand App &#8211; See These Must Consider Prerequisite Steps You Can’t Afford to Miss:</strong></h2>
<h3></h3>
<h3></h3>
<h3></h3>
<h3><strong>Do a Market Research</strong></h3>
<h3></h3>
<h3></h3>
<h3><strong><em>Competitors:</em></strong></h3>
<p>Collect data and try to understand the various strategies that your competitors have applied in their business. Look out for all the weaknesses and mistakes your rivals made in their journey &#8211; so that you’re not doing any of that.</p>
<p>You can then come up with better strategies to avoid any grave losses and grow your business fast.</p>
<h3><em><strong>Understand Your Target Audience:</strong></em></h3>
<p>Your app’s success purely depends on this factor. Survey your audience and see how their behavior patterns revolve around how they would like an on-demand app to be like. What is it that they don’t find attractive or questions like what incentivizes them to happily use an on-demand service?</p>
<p>Analyze their real pain points and question them on what they really want. By doing this, you’ll be able to devise clear goals and strategies accordingly.</p>
<p>All this will help you to know what is popular and what is not. So then you can take a good decision about what kind of app and what service you’d seek to provide.</p>
<h3><strong><em>Choose the Optimal Features:</em></strong></h3>
<p>If you’re launching a new app and want to know its viability as early as possible &#8211; then go for an <strong>MVP</strong> (<strong>Minimum Viable Product</strong>) to just add the most important features and have a safe start.</p>
<p>Some not to be missed out features include:</p>
<ul>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">Convenient Registration Method:</li>
</ul>
<p>Registration is necessary for user profiles, ratings, personalized journey experience etc. It’s thus imperative to add an easy and straightforward registration login method &#8211; with any social media account or email address.</p>
<ul>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">Tracking / Geolocation</li>
</ul>
<p>The geographical closeness of a service provider on the map is essential for saving both the parties some valuable time. Especially in delivery and transportation services it’s a necessity to specify pickup locations and destinations. Watching your taxi coming on a screen map is a very interactive experience and the customers simply love it.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-19786 aligncenter" src="https://static.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/car-300x240.jpg" alt="Tracking Map" width="510" height="408" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/car-300x240.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/car.jpg 626w" sizes="(max-width: 510px) 100vw, 510px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">           <a href="https://www.pinterest.com">Source </a></p>
<ul>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">Notifications</li>
</ul>
<p>Push notices play a great role in customer experience. Notify the users regarding payments, ratings, and other essential things that sum up to a complete customer journey.</p>
<ul>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">Reliable and Easy Payments</li>
</ul>
<p>People tend to super conscious when there is anything that involves their money or identity. So your payment system should be transparent and as secure as you can make it &#8211; to develop trust in your services. The best way is to use online financial payment services that are already reputable &#8211; like paypal.</p>
<ul>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">Feed back</li>
</ul>
<p>This is simply the rates and reviews of your customers about your service. This also develops an understanding in your customers &#8211; about the fact that you care.</p>
<ul>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">Help &amp; Support</li>
</ul>
<p>Who can ever leave this portion when they are providing real time on-demand services online. This feature assists customers in case of any queries. This in turn, adds to the company’s reputation.</p>
<h4><strong><em><u>Wisely Choose Technologies To Be Used</u>:</em></strong></h4>
<p>On-demand service app creation requires parcels of innovations, depending on the choices of technology platforms. Moreover, choosing a technology stage to construct an app for is the foremost crucial part because it straightforwardly relates to customers&#8217; media experience. In this way, you must launch the app on platforms that are popular among your target audience and keep close consideration to tech-related details. Generally, there are three sorts of platforms you need to check-out:</p>
<ul>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">Web Platform (runs in a web browser)</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">Native Platform (iOS / Android)</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">Cross-Platform Technology (a cost-effective way for both iOS &amp; Android Apps)</li>
</ul>
<h4></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong><em><u>Connect with the<a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co"> </a></u></em><em><u>Best Digit</u></em><em><u>a</u></em><em><u>l Agency Service Providers</u>:</em></strong></h4>
<p>Your service providers are the lifeline around which your whole business revolves. You can go with either of the two options in selecting your tech developer team:</p>
<p>1- <strong>In-house Teams: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">They can cater long-term projects with 24/7 support</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">It’s a more expensive option (you’ll be dealing with insurance, taxes, salaries, sick leaves and even vacations).</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2- <strong>Offshore Developers: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">A good choice for both long and short-term projects</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">Relatively economic (you’ll only pay against the amount of work done)</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">These teams are readily willing to sign a contract for the safety of both the parties</li>
</ul>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your business might have the best product or service around yet it will still be challenging to grow the enterprise if your sales and marketing efforts are lacking or non-existent. Alternatively, if your business&#8217;s offerings are similar or inferior to those provided by the competition, a savvy marketing/sales campaign can help you win even more market share. Below, we detail five marketing and sales tips to stimulate growth.</span></p>
<h2><strong>1. Use Social Media as a Sales and Marketing Tool</strong></h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-19446 size-large" src="https://static1.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/social-media-marketing-1024x510.jpg" alt="social media marketing" width="1024" height="510" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/social-media-marketing-1024x510.jpg 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/social-media-marketing-300x149.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/social-media-marketing-768x382.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/social-media-marketing-700x348.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social media started as a place for college students to socialize in a digital realm.  Nowadays, <a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/social-media-services/">social media marketing services</a> are used by businesses in all different sectors and niches. If your business does not have a social media presence, it is long past time to modernize.  Set up accounts on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and Instagram. Provide your online audience with helpful, informative and insightful content through these social media platforms. Tout your company&#8217;s offerings, discounts and new products/services in a subtle manner and you will bring that many more interested customers into the fold.</span></p>
<h2>2. Tailor Marketing Strategies to Your Target Customer</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-19453 size-large" src="https://static1.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/target-your-idea-customer-1024x512.png" alt="target your customers" width="1024" height="512" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/target-your-idea-customer-1024x512.png 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/target-your-idea-customer-300x150.png 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/target-your-idea-customer-768x384.png 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/target-your-idea-customer-1000x500.png 1000w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/target-your-idea-customer-700x350.png 700w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/target-your-idea-customer.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is no sense marketing to the masses if your offering has limited appeal. If you are not certain as to which demographics are most inclined to purchase your products/services, perform some research. Ask customers to fill out surveys to learn more about their backgrounds and needs. Interact with your company&#8217;s “foot soldiers” on the ground who spend time with your customer base. Such employees have valuable insight in regard to which types of people are purchasing your products at the highest frequency.</span></p>
<h2><strong>3. Initiate an SEO Push</strong></h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-19450 size-large" src="https://static1.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SEO-1024x552.jpg" alt="SEO Services" width="1024" height="552" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SEO-1024x552.jpg 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SEO-300x162.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SEO-768x414.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SEO-700x377.jpg 700w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SEO.jpg 1273w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spend the little bit of money necessary to boost your company&#8217;s <a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/seo-services/">search engine optimization</a> (SEO) and you will gradually enjoy an uptick in sales. SEO is centered on the strategic use of keywords and key phrases throughout online content from your website to your blog, social media and beyond. Aim for a keyword saturation rate between 1.5% and 2.5% with each piece of online content and through a <a href="https://plagiarismdetector.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">plagiarism check</a> as well. Though your <a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/seo-services/">SEO services</a> will take some time to produce meaningful results, this effort will make it that much easier for those genuinely interested in your offerings to find your online footprint through an online search.</span></p>
<h2><strong>4. Stay in Contact With Your Customers</strong></h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-19451 size-large" src="https://static3.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Customer-service-1024x584.jpg" alt="Customer-service" width="1024" height="584" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Customer-service-1024x584.jpg 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Customer-service-300x171.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Customer-service-768x438.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Customer-service-345x198.jpg 345w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Customer-service-700x400.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Part of the sales challenge is finding a way to get customers to think about your business and its offerings. If your target audience forgets about your company, they will not think twice before purchasing similar products or services from your competitors.  Aside from social media and traditional outbound advertising methods, you can also contact your target audience through an email newsletter. If customers are willing to opt into text messages, send texts from time-to-time to notify customers of new offerings, specials, discounts, and other relevant updates.</span></p>
<h2><strong>5. Start a Podcast</strong></h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-19449 size-large" src="https://static1.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/podcast-1024x536.jpg" alt="podcast" width="1024" height="536" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/podcast-1024x536.jpg 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/podcast-300x157.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/podcast-768x402.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/podcast-700x366.jpg 700w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/podcast.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Podcasting is easier than most business owners and managers think. All your business needs for a podcast is a computer and a microphone. Some customers simply do not enjoy reading the written word. Others are constantly on-the-go and do not have time to read lengthy blog posts or website pages. Prospective and current customers can easily listen to a 10-20 minute podcast while driving to work, jogging or doing chores around the house.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be Patient With Your New Sales and Marketing Strategies</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It will take some time for the strategies detailed above to result in a meaningful addition to your bottom line. If these techniques do not spur a sales spike after six months have passed, continue to tinker with your sales strategies. Stay the course, get expert help from a<a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/"> digital marketing agency</a> and it will only be a matter of time until your sales and marketing efforts propel your business to new heights.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As 2019 begins, the digital marketing terrain that encompasses search engine optimization (SEO), social media, pay-per-click (PPC), content marketing and more is witnessing a drastic shift. Gone are the days when you could have dismissed alternative ad networks or voice searches as gimmicks.</p>
<p>Of course, one can’t simply ignore the <a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/5-out-of-the-box-digital-marketing-examples-from-2018/">digital marketing examples from 2018</a> but there are many new digital marketing trends in the current high-tech and internet connected era that should be considered. Leveraging new marketing strategies will enable you to excel in the digital realm because what worked for you last year may not work this year.</p>
<p>Here are two key <a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/">digital marketing trends</a> to watch out for in 2019.</p>
<h2><strong>Alternative Ad Networks</strong></h2>
<p>Google and Facebook are excellent platforms for driving traffic to your website or social profile. But there are a few reasons to consider alternatives.</p>
<p>First off, the cost factor. In comparison to the alternative ad networks, Google and Facebook are charging advertisers pretty high. The <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/02/29/google-adwords-industry-benchmarks">average cost per click in AdWords</a> across all industries is $2.69 for the search network and $0.63 for the display network. Not to mention, the average cost of the most expensive keywords is <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2011/07/18/most-expensive-keywords-google-adwords">$55 a click</a>.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-18582 size-full" src="https://static1.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/average-cost.png" alt="average cost" width="800" height="913" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/average-cost.png 800w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/average-cost-263x300.png 263w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/average-cost-768x876.png 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/average-cost-700x799.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/02/29/google-adwords-industry-benchmarks">Source</a></strong></p>
<p>Whereas the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/02/28/facebook-advertising-benchmarks">average cost of Facebook ads</a> is $1.72 and it’s steadily rising as advertisers flock to the social platform.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-18583 size-full" src="https://static1.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/fb-cost.png" alt="FB average cost" width="800" height="692" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/fb-cost.png 800w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/fb-cost-300x260.png 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/fb-cost-768x664.png 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/fb-cost-700x606.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/02/28/facebook-advertising-benchmarks">Source</a></strong></p>
<p>On top of it, both Google and Facebook have strict restrictions for advertisers, which makes it even more challenging for businesses in certain niches to use these platforms effectively. This includes businesses in the pharmaceutical, gaming, and affiliate marketing industry.</p>
<p>But what factors should you consider when choosing other ad networks? Here are some <a href="https://www.invespcro.com/blog/mobile-commerce/">statistics</a> you  may want to take into account:</p>
<ul>
<li>95% of people look up for local business information on their phones.</li>
<li>People who shop via mobile devices tend to spend twice as much as those not buying on mobile devices.</li>
</ul>
<p>Nowadays, alternative ad networks offer more sophisticated targeting options than ever, such as different devices, demographic data, income, geographic location and more. Some even offer retargeting features, which puts your ads in front of the people who have already visited your site.</p>
<p>Ready to try an alternative ad network for your business? Here are three popular alternative ad networks you can use in your business for 2019:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>ONE by AOL: </strong>Formerly known as mmedia, the ONE by AOL is a mobile advertising platform that places ads across 50,000 mobile apps and websites. It gives you the flexibility with bidding, targeting, and In addition, there’s no minimum deposit. This makes it an ideal network for mobile advertisers with a limited or small budget.</li>
<li><strong>Airpush: </strong>Your <strong>digital marketing agency</strong> might already be using this. Airpush is another mobile ad network that allows businesses to reach viewers on more than 150,000 apps. Not only the network prides itself for transparency, but all the users opt for its ads. This means people are more receptive to view their ads than on any other competing mobile ad network.</li>
</ol>
<h2><strong>Voice Search and Smart Speakers</strong></h2>
<p>Hey Siri, get me directions to the nearest fast food restaurant.</p>
<p>Alexa, find me a dentist.</p>
<p>The increasing use of voice search has made it an integral part of digital marketing strategies in 2019. Wondering why?</p>
<p>50% of <a href="https://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/just-say-it-future-search-voice-personal-digital-assistants/1392459">all searches</a> are going to be voice searches by 2020.</p>
<p>30% of <a href="https://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/3482117">web browsing sessions</a> will be conducted without a screen by 2020.</p>
<p>20% of <a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-reveals-20-percent-queries-voice-queries-249917">mobile searches on Google</a> are now conducted by voice.</p>
<p>25% of <a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/bing-says-25-searches-voice-searches/163287/">all searches on Bing</a> are now by voice.</p>
<p>Voice search provides relevant information to people through audio content. With artificial intelligence (AI) getting smarter every day, voice assistants like Siri, Google, and Alexa are less likely to make errors.</p>
<p>Already, many brands have included voice search in their marketing strategies so they can effectively deliver value-based content to their prospects and customers. Domino’s Pizza is one example in this regard. The international fast food chain <a href="https://www.thedrum.com/news/2017/07/31/dominos-turns-amazon-echo-let-customers-order-pizza-using-only-their-voice">using voice search technology</a> to boost its sales.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><a href="https://thenextweb.com/apps/2016/04/06/maybe-just-this-butt-dialers-nightmare/">Source</a></strong></p>
<p>Smart speakers like Google Home and Alexa have also witnessed a rise in demand. According to <a href="https://www.cmo.com/features/articles/2018/9/7/adobe-2018-consumer-voice-survey.html#gs.SOiTmqPh">a recent study</a>, 32% of people now own a smart speaker and 71% of them use voice search every day. While <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/15/16892254/smart-speaker-ownership-google-amazon">65% of users</a> said voice-controlled assistant is essential to daily life.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-18585 size-full aligncenter" src="https://static1.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/smart-speakers.jpg" alt="smart speakers" width="600" height="389" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/smart-speakers.jpg 600w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/smart-speakers-300x195.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/smart-speakers-400x260.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><a href="https://www.soundandvision.com/content/smart-speakers-now-1-10-us-broadband-households">Source</a></strong></p>
<p>Mind you, not only more companies will produce audio content in the hopes of increasing brand awareness (and so should you) as ads are also likely to come in soon. The voice-controlled assistant will give you the answer to your question along with a “word from their sponsor”. This means soon your <a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/"><strong>SEO agency</strong></a> would suggest you purchase voice ad space.</p>
<p>And when you write for the voice technology make sure to adopt a conversational tone. Concentrate on getting snippets on Google and using keywords that people frequently use.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>2019 will be about improving customer experience by making use of alternative platforms and AI-powered technology to drive more targeted traffic and increase conversions.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Online presence is one of the most important, and perhaps most underutilized, tools to ensure success in today’s increasingly digital marketplace. Not only should it be easy to find your business online, but there should also be something clear and unique waiting for them at the end of their search. SEO, web design and digital marketing are key components in cultivating a <u><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/drewhendricks/2015/02/11/understanding-the-full-impact-of-web-design-on-seo-branding-and-more/?utm_source=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buzzinteractive.co&amp;utm_medium=BuzzBlog#360dd7cc64fe">robust digital presence</a></u>, and they are more connected than most understand. We are a team of designers, developers, and marketers, dedicated to providing our clients with personalized and unparalleled <a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/?utm_source=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buzzinteractive.co&amp;utm_medium=BuzzBlog&amp;utm_campaign=Clutch%20PR">digital marketing services</a>.</p>
<p>According to Clutch, a B2B ratings and reviews platform, Buzz Interactive is one of the top <u><a href="https://clutch.co/pk/agencies/digital-marketing?sort_by=field_pp_rank_digital_marketing&amp;field_pp_min_project_size=All&amp;field_pp_hrly_rate_range=All&amp;field_pp_size_people=All&amp;field_pp_cs_small_biz=&amp;field_pp_cs_midmarket=&amp;field_pp_cs_enterprise=&amp;client_focus=&amp;field_pp_if_advertising=&amp;field_pp_if_automotive=&amp;field_pp_if_arts=&amp;field_pp_if_bizservices=&amp;field_pp_if_conproducts=&amp;field_pp_if_education=&amp;field_pp_if_natural_resources=&amp;field_pp_if_finservices=&amp;field_pp_if_gambling=&amp;field_pp_if_gaming=&amp;field_pp_if_government=&amp;field_pp_if_healthcare=&amp;field_pp_if_hospitality=&amp;field_pp_if_it=&amp;field_pp_if_legal=&amp;field_pp_if_manufacturing=&amp;field_pp_if_media=&amp;field_pp_if_nonprofit=&amp;field_pp_if_realestate=&amp;field_pp_if_retail=&amp;field_pp_if_telecom=&amp;field_pp_if_transportation=&amp;field_pp_if_utilities=&amp;field_pp_if_other=&amp;industry_focus=&amp;field_pp_location_country_select=All&amp;field_pp_location_province=&amp;field_pp_location_latlon_1%5Bpostal_code%5D=&amp;field_pp_location_latlon_1%5Bsearch_distance%5D=100&amp;field_pp_location_latlon_1%5Bsearch_units%5D=mile&amp;utm_source=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buzzinteractive.co&amp;utm_medium=BuzzBlog&amp;utm_campaign=Clutch%20PR">digital marketing agencies in Pakistan</a></u>. Clutch uses metrics such as marketing presence, quality of work, and client reviews in order to gauge the quality of service providers in markets across the globe. After conducting in-depth market research for almost 100 of the top marketing firms in Pakistan, Clutch ranked Buzz Interactive as a top ten <a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/?utm_source=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buzzinteractive.co&amp;utm_medium=BuzzBlog&amp;utm_campaign=Clutch%20PR">Digital Marketing Agency</a>, earning us the title of “industry leader.”</p>

<p>Although analysts at Clutch evaluate service providers, the main purpose of the platform is to give clients an opportunity to review the firms that they have worked with. We value the opportunity to hear what our clients think of our services, and we are pleased that one of our clients has taken the time to share their experience with us. When asked about their time working with us, one client spoke to the level of attention they received, saying, “I would call or text them even when it was not their office hours, and they were polite enough to reply back the very second I sent them a message about anything.” We pride ourselves on our ability to provide the expertise of a large agency with a high level of personal attention for every client, and we are excited that our clients have taken notice.</p>
<p>We have also been recognized for our ability to leverage existing platforms to help our clients grow their businesses. LinkedIn has become the number one networking tool in the world, connecting businesses and professionals alike, proving itself an incredibly useful tool. LinkedIn is one of the best ways to market to other businesses, and we have been featured as one of the best LinkedIn marketers in the world. We were highlighted by <u><a href="https://themanifest.com/linkedin-marketing/agencies?utm_source=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buzzinteractive.co&amp;utm_medium=BuzzBlog&amp;utm_campaign=Clutch%20PR#buzzinteractive" class="broken_link">The Manifest</a></u> as one of the top LinkedIn marketing firms in the world. The Manifest is a business resource that provides industry insights, how-to-guides, and recommendations for service providers. They made note of our status as a smaller firm with a great deal of time and attention for our clients, and our presence on their list serves as a testament to the quality of our services and our ability to deliver for our clients.</p>
<p>We are grateful for our status <u><a href="https://medium.com/@clutch_co/top-15-digital-marketing-agencies-in-2018-b6a91e40fc3b?utm_source=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buzzinteractive.co&amp;utm_medium=BuzzBlog&amp;utm_campaign=Clutch%20PR" class="broken_link">marketing industry leaders</a></u>, but the whole of our focus goes to the work we do for our clients. Our ability to provide top quality services and unparalleled personal attention to each of our clients is what sets us apart, and we pride ourselves in the partnerships we have built. Thank you to everyone who has entrusted us with their digital presence and marketing efforts. Your support empowers us and we can’t wait to keep working with you.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Facebook is the third most visited website on the internet. According to the new numbers, the social platform has <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/264810/number-of-monthly-active-facebook-users-worldwide/?utm_source=BuzzInteractive.co&amp;utm_medium=BuzzBlog">2.23 billion monthly active users</a>.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-18529 size-full" src="https://static3.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/FB-Chart.jpg" alt="FB Chart" width="680" height="431" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/FB-Chart.jpg 680w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/FB-Chart-300x190.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>Facebook users are engaged and they love to consume content. This makes it one of the most reliable platforms to find qualified leads. But, when you are starting, it’s rather difficult to build a huge user base or quality audience right away. No matter how effective your <a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/social-media-services/">social media marketing</a> maybe or whatever <a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/content-recipe-ingredients-for-a-great-content/">content recipe</a> you use.</p>
<p>This leaves startups, growing businesses, and solopreneurs with a million dollar question: How exactly you can grow your Facebook following fast?</p>
<p>The easiest solution is to research your rivals and target their audience. Look at it this way; if your potential customers can be interested in a competing or similar service/product, why won’t your competitors’ users be interested in yours?</p>
<p>Here’s how you can target your competitor’s audience or even better see who are the people that are interacting with your rivals.</p>
<hr />
<p><em>#AmReading “How to Target Your Competitor’s Facebook Audience.</em><br /><a href='https://twitter.com/share?text=%23AmReading+%E2%80%9CHow+to+Target+Your+Competitor%E2%80%99s+Facebook+Audience.&#038;via=buzz_interactve&#038;related=buzz_interactve&#038;url=https://www.buzzinteractive.co/how-to-steal-your-competitors-facebook-audience/' target='_blank'>Click To Tweet</a></p>
<hr />
<p>Yes, being a <a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/">social media marketing agency</a> we are shooting ourselves in the foot here but we are still going to show you how exactly you can do that using an awesome Chrome extension along with <a href="https://scrapebook.net/">ScrapeBook</a> and another tool.</p>
<p>Ready to roll?</p>
<p>Let’s hit it.</p>
<h2><strong>Step #1 Find your competitor’s best performing posts</strong></h2>
<p>To get started, analyze your competitor’s Facebook post and find their best performing content. Or simply use these strings to do so:</p>
<ul>
<li>https://www.facebook.com/search/str/<strong>[put_your_competitor_domain_here]</strong>/stories-keyword/intersect</li>
<li>https://www.facebook.com/search/str/<strong>[put_your_competitor_keyword_here]</strong>/stories-keyword/intersect</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Make sure to edit the string and then copy, paste it into the browser field. Repeat this process every time you need to run a new search.</p>
<p>I am using this <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/gerardcompteduran?utm_source=BuzzInteractive.co&amp;utm_medium=BuzzBlog">Gerard Compte</a></strong> post as an example here:</p>
<p>https://www.facebook.com/search/str/<strong>Gerard%20Compte</strong>/stories-keyword/intersect</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-18520 size-full" src="https://static3.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/gerard-1.jpg" alt="gerard" width="514" height="605" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/gerard-1.jpg 514w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/gerard-1-255x300.jpg 255w" sizes="(max-width: 514px) 100vw, 514px" /></p>
<h2><strong>Step #2 Add the Chrome extension </strong></h2>
<p>Use this link to add the <a href="https://scrapebook.net/?utm_source=BuzzInteractive.co&amp;utm_medium=BuzzBlog">ScrapeBook</a> extension:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-18512 size-large" src="https://static2.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/scrapebook-1024x304.jpg" alt="scrapebook extension" width="1024" height="304" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/scrapebook-1024x304.jpg 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/scrapebook-300x89.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/scrapebook-768x228.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/scrapebook-700x208.jpg 700w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/scrapebook.jpg 1216w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Hit the blue button “Add to Chrome” to install this extension. As soon as you will add this Chrome extension, you’ll see “DOWNLOAD UIDs” under all the posts.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-18513 size-full" src="https://static.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/gerard-compte.jpg" alt="gerard compte" width="514" height="602" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/gerard-compte.jpg 514w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/gerard-compte-256x300.jpg 256w" sizes="(max-width: 514px) 100vw, 514px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That’s what this ScrapeBook Chrome Extension does. It gathers the UIDs of all the people who have liked a post or ad on your competitor’s Facebook page.</p>
<p>Click “DOWNLOAD UIDs” and get the data in a CSV file.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-18515 size-full" src="https://static.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/gerard-strategy.jpg" alt="gerard strategy" width="499" height="204" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/gerard-strategy.jpg 499w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/gerard-strategy-300x123.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 499px) 100vw, 499px" /></p>
<p>For instance, 68 people reacted to this post and you can squeeze a decent info from it. My advice would be to do this on posts that have hundreds of reactions if not thousands to get better results.</p>
<h2><strong>Step #3 Get More Information </strong></h2>
<p>Even with just the user&#8217;s IDs, you can do a lot of things. For example, you can auto-friend everyone. But, what I would like to do, instead, is extracting more useful information such as names and emails. It will help you build a great custom audience based on the users that are already interacting with your competitor’s content.</p>
<hr />
<p><em>#Getmore than just Facebook user IDs with the secret Chrome extension (names &amp; emails)</em><br /><a href='https://twitter.com/share?text=%23Getmore+than+just+Facebook+user+IDs+with+the+secret+Chrome+extension+%28names+%26amp%3B+emails%29&#038;via=buzz_interactve&#038;related=buzz_interactve&#038;url=https://www.buzzinteractive.co/how-to-steal-your-competitors-facebook-audience/' target='_blank'>Click To Tweet</a></p>
<hr />
<p>Here ScrapeBook will again come into play. It’s a cool tool that can squeeze valuable information out of Facebook posts. But it’s an invite-only tool so you have to see if a spot is available for you.</p>
<p>Once you gain access go to the “Post Emails Finder” feature. Then, copy and paste the value from the CSV file that you have recently downloaded using the ScrapeBook extension.</p>
