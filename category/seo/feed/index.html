								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>SEO is an un-ignorable segment of digital marketing for businesses; most marketers will agree to it. However, it’s only considered effective when it can present results that are valuable to the business.</p>
<p>No matter if you’ve hired a digital agency, a freelancer, or an in-house SEO, you’re wasting your resources if you’re not tracking results if you&#8217;re not keeping them accountable, and most important if you don&#8217;t know how to measure SEO performance, nothing will impact much.</p>
<p>But exactly why is it such a deal to track your SEO results?</p>
<p>Let’s have a systematic look at why measuring your SEO performance is not only important but is the basis of your entire marketing efforts.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Why SEO Measurement Matters for Your Business?</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Investing in SEO doesn&#8217;t mean the following vanity metrics that you don&#8217;t even understand. It means investing in a medium that has high business driving potential and possesses incredible scalability.</p>
<p>Basically, by measuring your SEO performance you’re getting the answers to 3 questions that are extremely valuable for your business.</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignnone wp-image-21811 size-full" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Icons.png" alt="SEO Measurement tracks business performance " width="1365" height="591" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Icons.png 1365w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Icons-300x130.png 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Icons-768x333.png 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Icons-1024x443.png 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Icons-700x303.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1365px) 100vw, 1365px" /></strong></p>
<p><strong>Is your business growing with SEO?</strong></p>
<p>Irrespective of what digital marketing segment you’re targeting, the goal at the end is always the growth of your business.</p>
<p>Let it be short term or long term, direct or indirect, the final aim is to grow strong roots for the business in the market. Thus by measuring the SEO KPI’s you’re directly measuring how much of an impact SEO has to help you achieve your business goals.</p>
<p><strong>Is SEO cost-effective for you?</strong></p>
<p>It’s always good to see some pages ranking better and your website providing a better user experience, however, what matters, in the end, is if your SEO is cost-effective for you?</p>
<p>The SEO KPI’s, with little understanding, will help an average business owner recognize if SEO is generating an outcome for their business.</p>
<p><strong>Is SEO the right marketing approach for you?</strong></p>
<p>Depending on the results you’re getting for your business and the progress you’re seeing in terms of SEO KPIs you can answer for yourself if SEO was the right approach for your business. The major variable factor here would be the industries.</p>
<p>Also if you look at it in comparison with the other marketing channels (SEO, social media, emails, etc.) you’ll know exactly what area do you need to scale in the future for the most growth.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><strong>What KPIs to Track for Effective SEO Measurement?</strong></h2>
<p>We’ve looked at the value SEO result’s measurement brings.</p>
<p>However, the question is, how does an average non-technical business owner know what “results” mean when it comes to SEO?</p>
<p>What exact key-performance indicators (KPI’s) should you track if you’ve invested your time &amp; energy in SEO?</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21812" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Icons_1.jpg" alt="KPIs to Track for Effective SEO Measurement" width="1365" height="640" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Icons_1.jpg 1365w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Icons_1-300x141.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Icons_1-768x360.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Icons_1-1024x480.jpg 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Icons_1-700x328.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1365px) 100vw, 1365px" /></p>
<h3><strong>1. Keyword’s Rankings</strong></h3>
<p>Nothing comes more obvious than Keyword rankings. Still for those who aren’t aware; Keyword’s rankings are the position your webpages are showing up on for respective targeted queries.</p>
<p>For example, if your target keyword was<strong> Paleo Diet </strong>and let’s says your website was ranking on the <strong>8th page</strong> when you started investing your time and resources into SEO, after a few months you should see it in a better position.</p>
<p>Of course, everyone would want their website ranking on the 1<sup>st</sup> result for all their targeted keyword. However, it won’t be the case. Some of your keywords will be ranked higher and some might not even make it to the 1<sup>st</sup> page at all.</p>
<p>However if collectively your keywords are ranking good overall (or are improving progressively), you’re moving in the right direction.</p>
<p><strong>How to track keywords rankings?</strong></p>
<p>Other than simply noting down the position of your website every month for particular keywords in a Google sheet, you’d have to use some kind of a keyword tracking tool as well. For this purpose, the Google search console is a good option.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21782" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/14.png" alt="Google Search Console UI" width="958" height="517" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/14.png 958w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/14-300x162.png 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/14-768x414.png 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/14-700x378.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 958px) 100vw, 958px" /></p>
<p>However, Google search console has its own limitations like not being able to track your competitor’s keywords positioning. Also, it doesn’t have a magnificently attractive user-interface either.</p>
<p>Thus you can also rely on some premium tools like Moz, SEMRush, and Ahrefs which let you keep a regular check on your keywords in a more convenient manner. Other than a better UI these tools (Ahref’s Keyword Explorer for example) give you a lot more insights and metrics like <strong>Keyword Difficulty</strong> which helps you contextualize a keyword’s ability to rank and generate business once ranked.</p>
<p><strong><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21784" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1.png" alt="Ahrefs Keyword Explorer UI" width="1266" height="705" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1.png 1266w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1-300x167.png 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1-768x428.png 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1-1024x570.png 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1-700x390.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1266px) 100vw, 1266px" />Why the keyword rankings are important?</strong></p>
<p>The position your website ranks on for a particular keyword will determine how visitors will it acquire from the search results.</p>
<p>In fact, the click-through rate gap between the 1st result and the 10<sup>th</sup> result on Google is remarkably high. Several studies have mentioned that the website ranking on the 1<sup>st</sup> position on Google gets around 32.5% of the entire clicks while the last one gets only 1.5%.</p>
<p><strong><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21785" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/9.png" alt="CTR Distribution in Google Rankings" width="751" height="831" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/9.png 751w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/9-271x300.png 271w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/9-700x775.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 751px) 100vw, 751px" />How not to think about Keyword’s Rankings?</strong></p>
<p>Now it’s very important to understand that SEO can be highly unpredictable. So expecting that your website will rank on a particular position after certain days isn’t the right way of thinking about this.</p>
<h2><strong>2. Organic Search Traffic</strong></h2>
<p>We all know that both SEOs and a business owner, who have invested in <a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/seo-services/">SEO services</a>, crave for organic traffic on their website. In fact, higher keyword rankings are nothing but an indicator of your website potentially receiving more organic traffic.</p>
<p>Note: Organic traffic is the traffic coming from search engines like Google as a result of efforts put into SEO.</p>
<p><strong>How to Track Organic Traffic?</strong></p>
<p>Organic traffic can be tracked if your website has a tracking code embedded in it of whatever the tool you want to track it with.</p>
<p>The best one is Google Analytics in this regard. Embedding the tracking code in your website’s header or footer, you can track every visitor coming to any of your web-pages and know the source of its visitors as well.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21786" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/19.png" alt="Organic Traffic in Google Analytics" width="958" height="449" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/19.png 958w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/19-300x141.png 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/19-768x360.png 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/19-700x328.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 958px) 100vw, 958px" />Google analytics has some tremendous sections which can give you useful insights about your organic traffic leading you to better SEO performance over time.</p>
<p><strong>Why Organic Traffic is important?</strong></p>
<p>One can argue that organic traffic is one of the topmost important metrics to track when it comes to SEO.</p>
<p>The reason?</p>
<p>Because all these visitors are actual people visiting your webpages with a particular intent. Either they’re interested in your product/service or the information you’ve provided relevant to your product/service.</p>
<p>In simple words, they’re your potential customers. Or at least some proportion of them is.</p>
<p>Secondly, since this traffic is dedicatedly the users clicking on your website from search engine result pages (not social media, email, or any other channel) you’ll get an exact idea of where your SEO is moving overall.</p>
<p><strong>How NOT to think about Organic Traffic?</strong></p>
<p>Not all traffic coming from search engines would be beneficial to your business. When it comes to organic traffic, it’s highly dependent on the keywords you’ve targeted. And what matters the most is the <strong>search intent</strong> of the user behind those keywords.</p>
<p>For example, if your business is about <strong>furniture</strong>, and the traffic on your website is coming from a blog post you wrote expressing your <strong>political views in the furniture industry</strong>, it won’t benefit at all. Since all those visitors are visiting with different search intent.</p>
<p>It’s not that all this traffic would be hazardous; it’s just that it will hardly move the needle for your business.</p>
<h2><strong>3. Backlinks </strong></h2>
<p>Backlinks have been nominated as the most important and sometimes the top 3 most important ranking factor when it comes to SEO.</p>
<p>Backlinks are simply the links pointed toward your website from other platforms or other websites.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21787" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/26.png" alt="What is a backlink" width="958" height="539" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/26.png 958w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/26-300x169.png 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/26-768x432.png 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/26-700x394.png 700w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/26-539x303.png 539w" sizes="(max-width: 958px) 100vw, 958px" />Google bot crawls the web on the basis of links primarily. Having more quality backlinks will directly correlate to higher search engine rankings and thus more traffic.</p>
<p><strong>How to Track Backlinks?</strong></p>
<p>For knowing about the backlinks your website already has, Google search console can be helpful. Just click on the ‘Links’ button in the sidebar and in the ‘External Links’ section you’ll find the backlinks your website has.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21788" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3.png" alt="Backlinks tracking in Google Search Console" width="1266" height="621" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3.png 1266w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3-300x147.png 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3-768x377.png 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3-1024x502.png 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3-700x343.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1266px) 100vw, 1266px" />Although Google search console does a fine job of listing the links our website has, there are still some better options, solely for this purpose.</p>
<p>For example, if you’re running an active link building campaign for your website, then the Google Search Console would have limited data. The reason is your lack of competitor’s data and the lack of links tracking with respect to time. In such cases, tools like <strong>Ahrefs and SEMrush</strong> are the best options.</p>
<p><strong><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21789" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2-2.jpg" alt="Backlinks tracking in Ahrefs Site Explorer" width="1266" height="618" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2-2.jpg 1266w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2-2-300x146.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2-2-768x375.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2-2-1024x500.jpg 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2-2-700x342.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1266px) 100vw, 1266px" />Why are B</strong><strong>acklinks Important?</strong></p>
<p>The links pointing to your website from other websites work just like endorsements for Google. That’s exactly it’s pointed our various times that not all links are created equal.</p>
<p>Backlinks coming from authoritative websites will have a higher impact than those coming from a newly developed website.</p>
<p>The primary reason for this distinction is that backlinks coming from a site is as strong as the own link profile of that website.</p>
<p>Thus when you receive a link from a website/web-page that itself has many links, your website takes a prominent jump in the search results. Link Juice is a term used by SEOs to define the value of a link passed on. This is how it works;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21790" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/18.png" alt="Link Juice Explanation " width="772" height="483" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/18.png 772w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/18-300x188.png 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/18-768x480.png 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/18-700x438.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 772px) 100vw, 772px" /></p>
<p>Here the <strong>webpage A</strong> has higher ranking capabilities than <strong>webpage B</strong> and it&#8217;s because of the fact that it&#8217;s receiving inbound links from more external websites compared to webpage B.</p>
<p>In simple words, how Google sees it is that if a well-established credible website links to another website, then the other one must be a credible resource as well.</p>
<p><strong>How NOT to Think About Backlinks?</strong></p>
<p>We’ve already established the fact that not all links are created equal. Neither should your approach towards link building be binary.</p>
<p>For example, if your website is about gardening and you get a link from an immigration company somewhere in the footer, it won’t help as much.</p>
<p>The reason is that all the factors that contribute to the strength of a backlink have been neglected. Some of those factors are;</p>
<ul>
<li>Relevancy</li>
<li>Anchor text</li>
<li>Surrounding text</li>
<li>Links Location on page</li>
<li>Link attribute used</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21791" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/23.png" alt="Backlinks Relevancy " width="958" height="539" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/23.png 958w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/23-300x169.png 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/23-768x432.png 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/23-700x394.png 700w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/23-539x303.png 539w" sizes="(max-width: 958px) 100vw, 958px" />These are just some of the factors that contribute to the strength of the backlinks you’re acquiring and the impact you’ll be able to see as a result of them.</p>
<h2><strong>4. Bounce Rate</strong></h2>
<p>The bounce rate is a user-metric that can potentially lead to higher or lower search engine rankings. A higher bounce rate means the users visit your website and then immediately bounces back to the search results.</p>
<p>The bounce rate is usually evaluated for the whole website as an average of the bounce rate per lading page on the site.</p>
<p>If users visit your website and navigate through different pages and then close the browser, it’d mean that they never bounced back. It represents that they came to your website, got their query answered, and left.</p>
<p>The same would be the case if the visitors bounce back to the search engine but type a totally different query this time.</p>
<p><strong>How to Measure the Bounce Rate?</strong></p>
<p>Your website’s bounce rate can be measured by looking at Google analytics. From the sidebar, click; <strong>Audience &gt; Overview </strong>and the following page will open up. At the pointed positions you can see the site-wide bounce rate of the website;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21792" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/7.png" alt="Bounce rate in Google Search Console " width="1266" height="621" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/7.png 1266w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/7-300x147.png 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/7-768x377.png 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/7-1024x502.png 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/7-700x343.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1266px) 100vw, 1266px" />One can also look at the bounce rate for the individual pages from the Google analytics report. Simply go to the; <strong>Acquisition &gt; Search Console &gt; Landing Pages</strong> to sort the data with respect to the landing pages on the website.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21793" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/5.png" alt="Bounce rate in Google Analytics by Landing Pages" width="1266" height="621" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/5.png 1266w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/5-300x147.png 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/5-768x377.png 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/5-1024x502.png 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/5-700x343.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1266px) 100vw, 1266px" />Note: You’ll have to connect Google Analytics with Google Search Console in order to get this data.</p>
<p><strong>Why Measuring Bounce Rate is Important?</strong></p>
<p>Google’s ultimate goal is to please and satisfy its users. And one metric of measuring searcher’s satisfaction with the result they’ve landed on is the bounce rate. A higher bounce rate would indicate that the searchers couldn’t find the answer they were looking for on your web-page.</p>
<p>If the searcher bounced back and clicked on some other result on Google search results, that’d indicate that the second website seemed like a better option for this query.</p>
<p>The result? The other website will outrank yours.</p>
<p>This phenomenon is called <strong>Pogo-Sticking</strong>.</p>
<p>Thus keeping a measure on your website’s bounce rate would give you an understanding of how pleased is your visitor with your website and if your website is solving the searcher’s query perfectly.</p>
<p><strong>How NOT to Think About the Bounce Rate?</strong></p>
<p>While the bounce rate is a highly important metric, it can also be misleading if you’ve not done your industrial research. A higher bounce rate is not always bad. The industry is a variable in this regard.</p>
<p>For example, if I am trying to find some <a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/">digital marketing services</a> then I’ll land on the website and navigate through the pages representing SEO, Social media, Design &amp; Development services.</p>
<p>That means a lower bounce rate. However if I am searching for a very specific problem; such as <strong><em>“How to access iCloud photos”</em></strong> I’ll land on the website, scan the page, find and read the specific paragraph that solves my problem, and will leave the website (bounce back).</p>
<p>I’ve got my answer, and I am a happy visitor even though I’ve raised the bounce rate. This isn’t problematic since I am not searching with the same query over and over again now.</p>
<p>So it’s more about the industry you’re playing in. Although there’s no certain answer with respect to industries, still we’ve gathered the bounce rate ranges data with respect to the industry a website is a part of.</p>
<h2><strong><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21794" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/4.png" alt="Bounce rate ranges by Industries " width="839" height="621" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/4.png 839w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/4-300x222.png 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/4-768x568.png 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/4-700x518.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 839px) 100vw, 839px" />5. Click-Through Rate</strong></h2>
<p>Click-through-rate is one of the primary metrics visible in the search console or Google analytics. In simple words, it’s the percentage of the users who click your Google search result out of all those who see it.</p>
<p>In a slightly more technical (and mathematical) definition, it’s the ratio between <strong>clicks and the impressions</strong> on your website receives from Google.</p>
<p><strong><img class="aligncenter wp-image-21795" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/11-1024x423.png" alt="CTR Formula" width="549" height="227" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/11-1024x423.png 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/11-300x124.png 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/11-768x317.png 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/11-700x289.png 700w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/11.png 1049w" sizes="(max-width: 549px) 100vw, 549px" /></strong></p>
<p><strong>How to Measure Click-Through-Rate?</strong></p>
<p>You don’t need any third-party tool or product in order to measure click-through-rate (CTR). You can access data from Google search console and Google analytics provided that you have the search console connected to Google analytics.</p>
<p>Here’s how it looks in the Google Search Console;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21796" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/17.png" alt="CTR in Google Search Console " width="958" height="517" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/17.png 958w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/17-300x162.png 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/17-768x414.png 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/17-700x378.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 958px) 100vw, 958px" />And here’s how CTR can be noted from Google Analytics;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21797" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/8.png" alt="CTR in Google Analytics" width="1266" height="621" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/8.png 1266w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/8-300x147.png 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/8-768x377.png 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/8-1024x502.png 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/8-700x343.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1266px) 100vw, 1266px" /></p>
<p>Just like all other metrics you can note the change in CTR for your whole website or any individual web-pages.</p>
<p><strong>Why Measuring CTR is Important?</strong></p>
<p>Measuring CTR is important for your overall SEO efforts in two ways.</p>
<p>First of all, you can see how effectively you have written your page’s Meta title that is displayed in the Google search results. In case the CTR is high, it means more people, who see your website on Google click it.</p>
<p>In case it’s low, it means people go through it in the search results but ignore clicking it like many mediocre websites.</p>
<p>Other than that, a higher CTR indirectly gives Google a signal that your website is satisfying the users that are searching for a particular query. And when you achieve a CTR higher than your competitors, your website will most likely be able to outrank them easily and get that more chunk of traffic.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://backlinko.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Backlinko</a></strong> did highly useful research in regards to this. Here&#8217;s the relation they discovered between CTR and Google search rankings;</p>
<p><strong><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21798" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/15.png" alt="CTR Study by Backlinko " width="958" height="901" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/15.png 958w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/15-300x282.png 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/15-768x722.png 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/15-700x658.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 958px) 100vw, 958px" />How NOT to Think About Increasing CTR? </strong></p>
<p>The problem most noob SEOs get themselves into is that in order to achieve a higher CTR for their website, they write click-bait Meta titles and descriptions. That does sound like a “smart” tactic if you believe Google is a dumb platform. They’re not!</p>
<p>Google’s advanced search algorithm tracks not only user metrics but also user behaviors. And when your visitor clicks in your click-bait titles, what do you think is going to happen? They’ll not find what they were looking for and will bounce back immediately indicating that your web page was nowhere closes to satisfying them with the result.</p>
<p>So what do we do instead? Satisfy searcher’s intent honestly and add click boosters in your Meta title and descriptions. Here’ are some examples of boosters to increase your CTR;</p>
<ul>
<li>Add numbers for credibility</li>
<li>Add dates for content freshness</li>
<li>Ask a Question to develop curiosity</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, instead of just writing; <strong>“Exercising tips for men” </strong>write something like; <strong>“10 Incredibly Effective Exercising Tips for Men Look Fit in 2020”.</strong></p>
<p>Certainly, asking a professional copywriter or <a href="https://www.essaysupply.com/writers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">essay writer online</a> to create top-notch meta descriptions and titles Google will love is something you should consider</p>
<h2><strong>6. Traffic Value</strong></h2>
<p>Measuring the website’s traffic is binary and can be done with one tracking code of Google analytics. But how do you know that the traffic your website is receiving every day is valuable to your business and the results are profitable for you overall?</p>
<p>One way of it is by looking at the keywords you’re targeting on your website. If they resonate with your product/service and business, you’re on the right track.</p>
<p>But how do we give a quantitative value to our website’s traffic?</p>
<p>One good metric for this is <strong>traffic value</strong>.</p>
<p>Traffic value for any website is the amount in dollars the same traffic would have cost to be acquired from paid search mediums instead of organic.</p>
<p>In simple words, it let you imagine the amount of money you’d have spent to get the traffic you’re getting right now if it wasn’t from SEO.</p>
<p><strong>How to Measure Traffic Value?</strong></p>
<p>Just to be clear, traffic value isn’t a metric provided or followed by Google. It’s a third-party metric like many other metrics like Domain Authority, Links velocity, etc.</p>
<p>Tools like Ahrefs, SEMRush, MorningScore, and many others give a unique traffic value to each website depending on the keyword your website ranks for.</p>
<p>Traffic value is found by multiplying the monthly paid traffic of each keyword with its CPC value.</p>
<p><strong><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21799" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/24.png" alt="Traffic value in Ahrefs" width="958" height="539" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/24.png 958w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/24-300x169.png 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/24-768x432.png 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/24-700x394.png 700w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/24-539x303.png 539w" sizes="(max-width: 958px) 100vw, 958px" /></strong></p>
<p><strong><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21800" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/25.png" alt="Traffic value in SEMRush" width="958" height="514" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/25.png 958w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/25-300x161.png 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/25-768x412.png 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/25-700x376.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 958px) 100vw, 958px" /></strong></p>
<p><strong>Why Measuring Traffic Value is Important?</strong></p>
<p>For people who aren’t as technical as a senior and experienced SEO, measuring the SEO efforts, even in terms of the website traffic, can be a little problematic.</p>
<p>Let’s say if I have chosen SEO over PPC and I am investing 3000$ per month on my website’s SEO. How do I know if my decision of choosing SEO was right? E</p>
<p>Even if I am getting good website traffic and sales how do I know if PPC would not have brought the same traffic under the same monetary value?</p>
<p>That’s where metrics like Traffic value come in. By giving an estimate of the amount you’d have to pay if you were to get those results via PPC, traffic value ensures that you picked the right thing for your business; SEO.</p>
<p><strong>How NOT to Think About Traffic Value?</strong></p>
<p>First of all, none of these third party tools are actually 100% when it comes to measuring traffic value for your website. The primary reason for this is that they’re not sure of the exact monthly or daily traffic your website is getting.</p>
<p>Thus you can’t bet all your measurements just on traffic value since its overall quantitative value would always be an estimation. It can be a close estimation but it will never be the perfect one.</p>
<h2><strong>7. Goals Completions</strong></h2>
<p>A goal is a specific action you want your visitor to take on your website. For example, it can be to fill a form, signup to your newsletter, buy products from your eCommerce store, or inquire about your services via the contact form.</p>
<p>Whenever a visitor on your website performs the action that you’ve specified to track, Google analytics tracking code can track it. The biggest benefit of it is precise data and better future tracking.</p>
<p><strong>How to Measure Goals Conversions?</strong></p>
<p>One of the best things about internet marketing as a whole is that tracking is really easy. Irrespective of the type of business you’re running online; an eCommerce store, a personal blog selling Ebooks, a local business website, etc. you can easily track every lead coming your way specifically from organic traffic.</p>
<p>You can create Goals in Google analytics and track any action that could be distinguished as a conversion. For example, a universal yet simple practice is putting a call to action or a contact form on the landing page that is receiving traffic from search engines.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21801" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/13.png" alt="Goals in Google Analytics " width="1266" height="621" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/13.png 1266w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/13-300x147.png 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/13-768x377.png 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/13-1024x502.png 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/13-700x343.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1266px) 100vw, 1266px" /></p>
<p>As soon as any visitor performs the specified action, it’ll be tracked as one goal completion.</p>
<p><strong>Why Measuring Goals Completion is Important?</strong></p>
<p>Every wise SEO believes that SEO is more about revenue than it is about rankings. In fact, rankings become kind of a vanity metric when it comes to measuring revenue and sales as a result of your SEO efforts.</p>
<p>The reason? Well, all marketing efforts are directed primarily to the following two goals;</p>
<ul>
<li>Sales</li>
<li>Brand awareness</li>
</ul>
<p>And SEO is nothing more than a digital marketing channel pursuing the accomplishment of the exact same goals as above.</p>
<p>Even the KPIs we mentioned earlier in the post is directly related to leads/business generation at the very end.</p>
<p><strong><img class="aligncenter wp-image-21802 size-full" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/21.png" alt="User journey from visitor to customer " width="812" height="425" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/21.png 812w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/21-300x157.png 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/21-768x402.png 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/21-700x366.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 812px) 100vw, 812px" /></strong></p>
<p><strong>How NOT to Look at Goals Conversions?</strong></p>
<p>The goal conversion in Google’s analytics means a different thing for every business owner. Thus first of all it’s important to understand the data in context to your business in specific and secondly you have to build systems to take the data to the next phase.</p>
<p>For example, let’s take our example. We’re a digital marketing agency and we get a lot of inbound leads (goal conversions) as a result of our overall marketing efforts; SEO, PPC, Email, Social, etc.</p>
<p>Now we have the data in Google analytics. But to keep it real, our <strong>sales team</strong> engages in, and apart from handling all the leads and converting them to clients, we also organize the data in a humane way. For example, if someone on our website fills a form twice, our team will count it one. It helps to avoid data irregularities overall.</p>
<p>In the same way, it’s important that you keep a record of your conversions, let it be eCommerce sales, clients, or sign-ups.</p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion </strong></h2>
<p>Measuring SEO does seem like rocket science but it’s not. All you need to do is demand the following;</p>
<ul>
<li>A clear goal and an action plan</li>
<li>Monthly performance reports</li>
</ul>
<p>Measuring the KPI’s we shared will make you enough of a pro to discuss and debate your SEO campaign with the agency you’ve hired.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The game of Search Engine Optimization SEO is not the same as before, as in it’s now taking some rad twists. With the onslaught of fast innovation in technology, the growing need of internet users to get the best out of search engines is swiftly evolving the process of SEO techniques a lot &#8211; in 2019.</p>
<p>In 2019, any <a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/seo-services/">seo agency</a> or expert would need to go a mile further in their strategies for ranking higher. This requires incorporating the new trends in SEO planning, and looking out for the changing patterns of doing search by internet users.</p>
<p>This article precisely focuses on the most striking trends in SEO that’ll also play a decisive role in how the future of SEO is going to be like.</p>
<p>If you want your website to rank high in search results this year, as well as in future, then you’ll have to understand and follow the following 4 trends:</p>
<h1><strong>Mobile First Indexing:</strong></h1>
<p>As per Google’s initiative, mobile first indexing is a way Google will be ranking websites on the basis of how well a website is optimized for mobile phones. This means that the search results you see on google will now directly take you to the mobile version of a website.</p>
<p>Google began the process of migrating websites to mobile first index in March 2018. And in July 2019 (this year), Google further announced that all new domains will only be assessed using mobile first principles. Once a site is migrated, mobile version will be used as a means for ranking.</p>
<p>And all the above is for good reason too.</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; ★ Mobile devices now account for 3 in almost 5 of all the searches online.</p></blockquote>
<h3><strong>See These Steps To See How You Can Make Your Site Mobile Compatible:</strong></h3>
<p><strong><em>1-</em></strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Make your content same for both desktop as well as mobile version. For instance, the page should not ask the mobile user to click on options like “read more” to read further. Consult expert </em><a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/seo-services/"><em>website seo services</em></a><em> in this regard to make all your pages optimize from every angle possible.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>2-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></strong><em>Stop using the “m version” (mobile site version) and optimize for the responsive version.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>3-</em></strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set up “mobile accelerated” pages on your web server. This will make your website to load quickly.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>4-</em></strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select themes that are mobile responsive.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>5-</em></strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do go to Google and search for Google Mobile Responsive Test and explore what google says about your site’s mobile friendly performance.</em></p>
<h2><strong>Voice Search Optimization:</strong></h2>
<p>The concept of voice search refers to speaking, instead of typing in your query on a search bar. This allows the user to just say something and get relevant results from search engines like google.</p>
<p>Voice Search has not yet gathered immense popularity in 2019, but the statistics tell a lot about how this trend will become much more prevalent among internet users by 2020 and so forth.</p>
<blockquote><p>★ Experts say that by 2020, 50% of all searches will be voice searches.</p>
<p>★ Users of voice assistants are growing year-after-year to an extent that today, one in six Americans now own smart speakers.</p>
<p>★ And that 35.6 million US citizens use a voice activated device once a month.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>Mr. Michael Bonfil</em> is a managing director at SEM International who asserted the importance of voice search as a game changer for multinational and multilingual websites in these words:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Hopefully, marketers will realize in 2019 that the effective use of voice response can’t be done by translators (machine or human). The use of voice is, and can be very different from country to country, region to region, dialect to dialect, social class to social class, etc.,”.</p></blockquote>
<p>According to <em>Solis</em>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“While ‘voice’ might be an easier way to request answers in some scenarios, it certainly isn’t the ideal format to fulfill the intent in more complex answers (e.g., when comparing services or products).”</p></blockquote>
<p>That being said, comes the role of an SEO services company where it’ll need to delve deep inside to better optimize your websites for voice searches. But this is not as easy as it seems.</p>
<p>You see, natural language requests are way different from what users type-in in the search bar of a search engine. Voice search essentially comes with keywords that are long-tailed and a little tricky &#8211; to be precise.. This is why <a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/seo-services/">top SEO companies</a> are readily making sure that they understand the users’ language well, and incorporate voice strings that match what users are speaking.</p>
<blockquote><p>★ 40% of users are already using voice search over normal keyed in searches.</p></blockquote>
<p>This trend will only grow in the future. Voice search optimization is not just a matter of choice now, it’s an imperative for ranking higher in the coming years. So start doing it from now on.</p>
<h3><strong>So how to generate more voice search traffic by SEO optimization? Here are some basic steps:</strong></h3>
<p><strong><em>&nbsp;1-</em></strong><em>&nbsp; Use long-tail keywords.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>&nbsp;2-</em></strong><em>&nbsp; Make sure your site is compatible with a HTTPS framework. This optimizes a website to generate much more traffic from voice search. As 65% of results from voice search are against those sites that have HTTPS.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>&nbsp;3-</em></strong><em>&nbsp; Build an authoritative domain. Study’s found that sites that have a lot of links, content, social shares and good user experience, get the lion’s share of voice search.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>&nbsp;4-</em></strong><em>&nbsp; Your website must “load fast”. Should be precisely 4.6 seconds or faster. 4.6 is 50% faster than the average web page.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>&nbsp;5-</em></strong><em>&nbsp; You need to have short answers within your content. So long content is good for SEO health, and it should also have answers to explain the specific terms you are using so people can directly access through voice search.</em></p>
<h3><strong>Blockchain SEO:</strong></h3>
<p>Blockchain technology is a complex system of online records for supporting online verification, and ensuring secure movement or exchange of assets. It’s a kind of ledger that’s decentralised &#8211; meaning there is no third party that solely oversees these records. And this ledger is accessible by everyone on the network. This makes the record similar to a spreadsheet shared among all the participants. Blockchain spreadsheets get simultaneously updated time-to-time. Furthermore, if anyone tries misrepresenting data, the blockchain will detect discrepancy and nullify it by itself. Also it’s close to impossible for anyone to tamper with so many record strings &#8211; that are essentially attached together through blockchains.</p>
<p>Blockchain technology will hugely impact the SEO landscape from now on.</p>
<p>As <em>David Lockie</em> the founder of <em>Pragmatic</em> said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Websites will be able to record the identity of their visitors or log the number of token rewards that a blog post has secured. It’d even calculate which visitors have added value to specific posts and the actions they took”. And goes on to say: “All of this would input into ranking factors and make the web a more robust and productive social graph, almost infinite in its scope”</p></blockquote>
<p>Another benefit of blockchain is reduction in PPC (Pay Per Click) advertising fraud. This will encourage people to feel secure while clicking through Ads to landing pages of websites.</p>
<p>Eventually it’d lead to more traffic, more time on pages, boosted conversions, along with betterment in other metrics responsible for strong SEO.</p>
<p>Now for applying blockchain to websites will require SEO experts and web developers to work in close liaison.</p>
<p>By doing this, website owners will have organic search benefits apart from the display of information from blockchain transactions.</p>
<h3><strong>Amazon Search Optimization:</strong></h3>
<p>Google search engine is the best of the best for getting information for almost anything you want. This makes Google the King of the market. But when it comes to e-commerce activity, Amazon seems to rule the roost. Everyday, more and more people are using the internet for e-commerce to fulfill their shopping needs.</p>
<p>Now Amazon is not at all a universal search engine, but its algorithms are similar to that of Google and that Amazon gets the lion’s share of all e-commerce traffic from across the globe.</p>
<p>A great number of SEO experts witnessed a huge growth in Amazon Search Optimization.</p>
<blockquote><p>★ According to a study by Kenshoo, 72% of consumers in the UK, US, Germany and France are using Amazon to look for products online.</p>
<p>★ 56% consumers prefer going to Amazon first before they check on other platforms.</p>
<p>★ And conversely, 52% always check with Amazon after finding products elsewhere.</p></blockquote>
<p>Plus, they don’t just find products – they find everything they need that they would otherwise need Google for, i.e product reviews, similar product suggestions, and all kinds of other products that you might be interested in.</p>
<p>In other words, they really don’t need another search engine in place of Amazon to find what they need or want to buy.</p>
<p>Neither do they feel the need to do a research elsewhere before making any purchasing decisions.</p>
<blockquote><p>★ In fact, <em>BigCommerce</em>’s Global Omni-Channel Consumer Shopping Research Report says: When it comes to making a real purchase, people favour Amazon because of its convenience, pricing and ease of shipping.</p></blockquote>
<h3><strong>See These Important Points To Ensure Visibility On Amazon:</strong></h3>
<p>Now if you have a product of your own to be sold online. Introducing it on Amazon and optimizing it for visibility should be a number one priority if you want fast sales results. Consider the following:</p>
<p>Relevance-Related Ranking Factors on Amazon:</p>
<h3><strong>Product Title:</strong></h3>
<p>Your product’s title should be such that it should be relevant to what customers are searching.</p>
<p>For Example: The top 4 product results on Amazon for the&nbsp; search “machine oil” have both words written in the description i.e “machine” &amp; “oil”. Hence your product description’s wording must rhyme with what users are searching on Amazon.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="https://www.amazon.com">Source</a></p>
<h3><strong>Amazon Backend Keywords:</strong></h3>
<p>These are the keywords that are used in your Amazon account’s backend section only. The purpose is to tell Amazon’s algorithm about which keywords are targeting what product listings.</p>
<p>From a typical Google SEO perspective, think of these keywords as the meta tags that tell Google what your webpage is about. This essentially helps the search engine to show your product to people searching in specific keyword terms.</p>
<p>Remember to not repeat any words, and avoid including too many variations of the same word.</p>
<h3><strong>Product’s Description and Bullet Points:</strong></h3>
<p>This is where you can tell your customers more about your products &#8211; in detail. Product description area is another asset where you put relevant keywords in order to stay on top of search results. For this, try your best to keep the copy readable and natural as this would resonate with your customers beyond the SEO you did via keywords.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Did you know business websites that have local backlinks from authentic sources see more traffic?</p>
<p>Well, if you didn’t, it still isn’t too late to reinvent or hike your search visibility. Take a look at the following top 4 <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/local-seo">local SEO strategies</a> that are a must for business owners as well as <a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/seo-services/"><strong>local</strong> <strong>SEO agencies</strong></a> in 2018 and beyond.</p>
<h3><strong>1. Link Building:</strong></h3>
<p>Local link building exists, and it had been a secret weapon of SEO experts for quite some time now. But 2018 gives you another opportunity to understand and implement local link building strategies.</p>
<p>It is important to understand that general backlinks and local links differ from one another. It can be determined from the fact that even if your website niche is different from your local links, they’ll bring you more value. Now, this is something that Google’s algorithm also counts.</p>
<p>However, to bring the traffic to your website with local backlinks it is essential to put in some reasonable efforts. For instance, Buzz Interactive, a leading<a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/"><strong> digital marketing agency</strong></a>, focus on the following spheres to help its clients grow fast:</p>
<ul>
<li>Look for opportunities to get local sponsorships.</li>
<li>Contribute to charities and gain quick local links.</li>
<li>Take part in local community activities and try to gain access to their sites.</li>
<li>Get coverage in local media, portals and social media.</li>
<li>Do some solid local advertising to grasp your target audience’s attention.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-18468 size-full" src="https://static1.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/image-optimization.png" alt="image optimization" width="620" height="300" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/image-optimization.png 620w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/image-optimization-300x145.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></p>

<h3><strong>2. Image Optimization:</strong></h3>
<p>If you think that optimization for local SEO is just limited to text, then think again. Owing to the progressively blended nature of search results, you also get to see images on the search listings. So it’s critical to optimize your images to improve your search rankings.</p>
<p>When building your website, make sure all the images are search engine-friendly. There are billions of images on the web and if you are using a generic filename for your image like “image54321.jpg” it will get lost in the pile. Instead, if you use something descriptive it will be easier for your images to appear in search results.</p>
<p>Sure, your local SEO agency will tell you that search engines cannot read images, but what they won’t tell you is it’s up to you whether you use alt tags to describe your images and allow them to appear in relevant queries.</p>
<p>All you need to do is write a concise and relevant description. Don’t forget to add appropriate keywords. Write content above and below the images of your site and add appropriate keywords. The more text is related to the pictures, the better it is.</p>
<p>However, if you want your images to rank against local keywords, then add local keywords where possible to get blended results optimized for a certain local area. Of course, there are no shortcuts to rise to the top of search engine rankings, especially when there is a cut-throat competition in the industry. But with a smart approach that leverages your geo-location, you can certainly dominate your competition in specific key areas.</p>
<p>Smart business owners give themselves every chance to overcome their competitors. So give yourself an advantage by narrowing down your keyword and topic search and increasing your location-specific relevance. This is the best way to dominate big players since it will allow you to outshine them in relevance for your chosen focal points.</p>
<h3><strong>3. Local Business Directories:</strong></h3>
<p>Today, a large number of people rely on yellow pages and internet searches to get local businesses information. So, you have to be on that list for people that are looking for your business. Again, it’s a significant opportunity to get local links.</p>
<p>But while you do so, make sure your profile is complete. Instruct your local SEO agency to submit consistent contact details of your business and update the profile on a regular basis. The basic idea here is to hunt for local business directories relevant to your niche. With these local directories’ links, you will get more relevant and profitable traffic.</p>
<h3><strong>4. Reviews &amp; Ratings:</strong></h3>
<p>Customer reviews and ratings are the strengths of an online business. They have a profound impact on the business and traffic. Therefore, it’s important to promote positive reviews and ratings and use the negative ones to your advantage.</p>
<p>According to a study, about 70% of customers give genuine reviews and ratings on business websites when asked. While about 85% of people trust these reviews and ratings when making decisions. So the more positive reviews and ratings you have on your business page, the better it is to snag more revenue.</p>
<p>But again, pay attention as to where you can get these reviews in order to enable link building. Mind you, getting reviews and ratings on social media business pages such as LinkedIn or Facebook and Google business pages can prove quite useful.</p>
<p>In short, local SEO plays a vital role, so rather ignoring it one must implement these strategies and get the best out of this practice.</p>
