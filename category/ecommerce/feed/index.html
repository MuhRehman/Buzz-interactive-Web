<h2>8 Ecommerce Website Design Best Practices to Follow</h2>
<p>Now when you know it&#8217;s the significance, let’s dig right into effective eCommerce website design best practices to boost your conversions and impact your sales.</p>
<h3><strong>1. User-Centered Design </strong></h3>
<p>When it comes to having a user-centered website design, Apple can be an exceptional example of this practice. Not only Apple website&#8217;s homepage catches your attention in the very first look but also engages the user into the appealing display of their latest product, iPhone 11 Pro in this case.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-21301 size-full" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/user-in-min.jpg.png" alt="User Centered Ecommerce Website Design" width="1365" height="560" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/user-in-min.jpg.png 1365w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/user-in-min.jpg-300x123.png 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/user-in-min.jpg-768x315.png 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/user-in-min.jpg-1024x420.png 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/user-in-min.jpg-700x287.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1365px) 100vw, 1365px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The most essential thing when designing an eCommerce website that boosts your sales is keeping your user in mind. Better representation and good user experience is a success for any eCommerce website.</p>
<p>Your design has a lot to do with your customer conversion rate. For instance, your website could easily turn any visitor to a buyer when it includes every necessary minor detail required for a user. Keep yourself in the shoes of your audience and test any ecommerce website so that you get a clear vision of what a visitor sees at first when buying any stuff online. Likewise, your website could also get examined by anyone on the grounds of appearance, usability, and user satisfaction.</p>
<p>Before moving forward, assess yourself by answering these.</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Do you know what are you selling? </em></li>
<li><em>Do you really know who are you selling to? </em></li>
</ol>
	<div class="vc_empty_space"  style="height: 22px" ><span
			class="vc_empty_space_inner">
			<span class="empty_space_image"  ></span>
		</span></div>


<p>When you are certain about these questions, it makes it easy for you to get designed a website that matches your product.</p>
<h3><strong>2. Effective Product Showcase </strong></h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21302" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/products-1.jpg" alt="Effective product showcase in ecommerce website design" width="1365" height="560" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/products-1.jpg 1365w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/products-1-300x123.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/products-1-768x315.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/products-1-1024x420.jpg 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/products-1-700x287.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1365px) 100vw, 1365px" />Online shopping is growing impressively and it doesn’t appear to slow down at any point shortly.</p>
<p>“In 2018, an estimated <strong>1.8 billion people</strong> worldwide purchased goods online (Statista, 2018)”</p>
<p>People love to shop online and the reason may vary from convenience to easy price comparisons. Being an online seller, what you need to make sure is that online shopping experience matches perfectly with in-person experience of shopping.</p>
<p>Your shoppers can not touch or feel your product online but there are ways to let them feel the quality of it by properly and effectively showcasing your product that leaves an awful impression on them.</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Give attention to every detail. </em></li>
<li><em>Do better photography. </em></li>
<li><em>Always show what the latest is.</em></li>
</ol>
	<div class="vc_empty_space"  style="height: 22px" ><span
			class="vc_empty_space_inner">
			<span class="empty_space_image"  ></span>
		</span></div>


<p>Choosing a design that highlights the product well is very crucial. If you miss a product image or description, you are persuading the visitors to get off the website. Write product descriptions that offer complete information and answer the following questions:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Who is this product for?</em></li>
<li><em>How does this product work? </em></li>
<li><em>What is this product used for? </em></li>
<li><em>Why is it different? </em></li>
<li><em>Why should anyone buy it? </em></li>
</ol>
	<div class="vc_empty_space"  style="height: 22px" ><span
			class="vc_empty_space_inner">
			<span class="empty_space_image"  ></span>
		</span></div>


<p>The features and benefits of the product should be evident. You need to tell them how the features are useful to them and what benefits they are going to get from them.</p>
<p>According to research, the content that has relevant visuals receive 94% more views than the content that does not include visuals. When it comes to an ecommerce website, your product image communicates to your visitors more than the description.</p>
<p>Follow these tips for your product images that can boost sales and conversions:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Use high-resolution images </em></li>
<li><em>Click multiple images from different angles </em></li>
<li><em>Images that can be zoomed in or out </em></li>
<li><em>Big and clear product images</em></li>
</ol>
	<div class="vc_empty_space"  style="height: 22px" ><span
			class="vc_empty_space_inner">
			<span class="empty_space_image"  ></span>
		</span></div>


<p>Since we’re moving forward, so people believe that the latest is always better than the past and the cutting edge items are better in quality and that’s how it becomes one of the ways to capture the attention of your shoppers.</p>
<h3><strong>3. Mobile-Responsive Design </strong></h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-21176 size-full" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1-1.jpg" alt="Mobile-Responsive Design of an eCommerce website" width="1365" height="445" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1-1.jpg 1365w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1-1-300x98.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1-1-768x250.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1-1-1024x334.jpg 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1-1-700x228.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1365px) 100vw, 1365px" /></p>
<p>Research from Google shows that 73% of shoppers will move from an inadequately structured mobile website to one that makes buying simpler. Mobile responsive design is a must-have for ecommerce businesses since the number of mobile users is increasing rapidly.</p>
<p>Higher readability and ease of use is going to benefit your website a lot. Make sure that the mobile experience for your user is up to the mark. You can do this by asking your family or friends to test the responsiveness when they purchase from their mobile phones.</p>
<p>If you want to boost your sales and become a top-ranking ecommerce website, make improvements on your mobile design because the search engines such as Google, Bing, and Yahoo prefer the websites that have a responsive mobile design and put their user experience above all.</p>
<h3><strong>4. Show Site Security </strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><img class="aligncenter wp-image-21271 size-full" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/3.jpg" alt="An eCommerce website showing site security in its design" width="803" height="371" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/3.jpg 803w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/3-300x139.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/3-768x355.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/3-800x371.jpg 800w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/3-700x323.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 803px) 100vw, 803px" />Source:</strong> Sandbox</p>
<p>If you own a physical store, you ensure to hire security guards and put your resources into cameras or alarms to guarantee that you are providing your customers an environment where they can shop safely. In the same way, you should be careful about the security of your ecommerce website as well.</p>
<p>In the past 10 years, many cyber-attacks have occurred. The contact and credit card information of more than 110 million of the customers was compromised in 2013 of retail giant Target. In another incident, it was reported that the encrypted passwords or IDs of 38 million users of Adobe were accessed by the attackers. Data breaches are responsible for creating a negative effect on the reputation of any brand.</p>
<p>Do you now see the importance of securing your ecommerce website? No one will ever shop from your website if it seems to be untrustworthy.</p>
<p>You need to make all the essential modifications and adopt a strong strategy on your site for its security. The checkout page should have a lock icon in the address bar or at the bottom of the page. This is an indication that the page contains sensitive information and is secured.</p>
<p>What else can you do to prove that your site is secure and safe?</p>
<p>Make sure to display the security badges that your website has. But you do not have to be fraudulent just to gain the trust of your customers. Only use those badges that you have, otherwise, you may get involved in a legal issue in case of misleading your visitors.</p>
<h3><strong>5. Contact Information </strong></h3>
<p>If your customer has something to ask or is getting confused while making a purchase, he is probably going to go to the contact us page. And this is the part where you can make your customer service process very smooth.</p>
<p>Your contact information should be easy to find for a customer. Do not ever forget to put your email address or phone numbers on your homepage if you do not want to lose a customer. You can add plenty of options to help customers contact you without any hindrance:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Email address </em></li>
<li><em>Phone numbers </em></li>
<li><em>Contact form </em></li>
<li><em>Widget to send a direct message to your Facebook page</em></li>
<li><em>Live chat feature </em></li>
</ol>
	<div class="vc_empty_space"  style="height: 22px" ><span
			class="vc_empty_space_inner">
			<span class="empty_space_image"  ></span>
		</span></div>


<p>When you provide complete customer support and contact information, you indirectly get these key advantages:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Increased sales</em></li>
<li><em>Efficient and fast communication </em></li>
</ol>
	<div class="vc_empty_space"  style="height: 22px" ><span
			class="vc_empty_space_inner">
			<span class="empty_space_image"  ></span>
		</span></div>


<h3><strong>6. Easy Checkout </strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><img class="aligncenter wp-image-21274 size-full" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2.jpg" alt="Easy Checkout example in an eCommerce website design" width="803" height="371" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2.jpg 803w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2-300x139.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2-768x355.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2-800x371.jpg 800w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2-700x323.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 803px) 100vw, 803px" />Source:</strong> Skullcandy</p>
<p>The checkout page is considered to be the most important page of any ecommerce website. It needs to be given proper attention by the designers.</p>
<p>Imagine a scenario where your customer is proceeding to a checkout page after adding a few items into the cart and has got perplexed by a lengthy form to be filled. You certainly do not want to make the same mistake. Do you?</p>
<p>This page converts your visitor to a customer only if the design provides a smooth transition for everyone. If you have not convinced your buyer then he would probably leave your site having a complicated checkout method. This is the reason 7 out of 10 carts get abandoned. There are specific elements of the simplicity of checkout page, now let’s take note of these:</p>
<p><strong><em>Minimal form design:</em></strong> Keep the design of the minimal and do not annoy your customers by asking too much information that never seems to end.</p>
<p><strong><em>Step by step process:</em></strong> You need to direct your customers through every stage such as personal information, billing, and shipping details.</p>
<p><strong><em>Customizing orders:</em></strong> Allow your customers to update or customize their orders if they want to make any changes to their shopping cart after they have visited the checkout page.</p>
<p><strong><em>Account registration</em></strong>: You do not have to force the users to create an account before completing their checkout process. It can be irritating for a very first time visitor.</p>
<p>Moreover, to cater to a wide range of shoppers you have to provide numerous payment options. Payment solutions should not be restricted. This can give a boost to sales and conversion rates.</p>
<h3><strong>7. Reviews or Testimonials </strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><img class="aligncenter wp-image-21273 size-full" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1.jpg" alt="Reviews and Testimonials in an eCommerce website design" width="803" height="371" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1.jpg 803w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1-300x139.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1-768x355.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1-800x371.jpg 800w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1-700x323.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 803px) 100vw, 803px" />Source:</strong> Trustpilot</p>
<p>There is a survey by iPerceptions showing that customers are 63% more likely to purchase from a website that has their customer reviews.</p>
<p>You can go for testimonials or reviews, it depends on your website structure or choice.</p>
<p>It is not enough to sell a product backed by your words only. Every ecommerce site should clearly show their product reviews to provide a better shopping experience for their potential customers. Furthermore, replying to your customer reviews also gives a good impression on your visitors as it shows that you care about what they say. You can always improve your product or service through your negative or positive reviews.</p>
<h3><strong>8. Simplified Navigation Bar </strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><img class="aligncenter wp-image-21272 size-full" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/4.jpg" alt="Simplified Navigation Bar Example in an eCommerce website" width="803" height="371" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/4.jpg 803w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/4-300x139.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/4-768x355.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/4-800x371.jpg 800w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/4-700x323.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 803px) 100vw, 803px" />Source:</strong> Bliss</p>
<p>It is a critical part of an ecommerce store. Simplified and better navigation is a source of good user experience leading to more sales. Poor navigation can easily frustrate the user increasing the bounce rate.</p>
<p>Are the products on your site easier to find?</p>
<p>When your visitors are unable to locate their desired items, it can affect your current and future sales.</p>
<p>Let’s now look at the good navigation tips for your ecommerce stores:</p>
<p><strong>Prominent parent categories:</strong> Your customers should be able to see the parent categories at top of the page.</p>
<p><strong>Subcategories:</strong> Using subcategories make your site more specific with filtered options creating the opportunities for better conversions and metrics.</p>
<p>For example, ‘Chewy’ pet supplies website, has a parent category of ‘Shop by Pet’ which leads to a drop-down menu of all the subcategories under it such as cat, dog, fish, bird, etc.</p>
<p><strong>New arrival category:</strong> You can also add the category for new arrivals or latest items which can make new product browsing smoother.</p>
<p><strong>Search bar: </strong>Have a prominent search bar on the homepage.</p>
<p>Designing simple yet perfect navigation on your eCommerce website shows that how invested your store is in the shopping experience of its customers.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Payment gateways in Pakistan are a significant impact holder when it comes to the digitalization of the country.</p>
<p>Businesses aiming to sell their products or services online face the biggest challenge when it comes to finding the best payment gateways in Pakistan.</p>
<p>Here we’ll dive deep into the finest (&amp; various) options available in the market, in different sectors, some of which you weren’t even aware existed.</p>
<p>But first, let’s start with the fundamentals.</p>
<h2><strong>What is a Payment Gateway?</strong></h2>
<p>Payment gateways are the technologies used by sellers to accept debit/credit card payments from their customers.</p>
<p>This not only refers to the card reading devices often found in brick &amp; mortar stores but also points to the online systems making an entrance of consumer’s money in the seller&#8217;s pocket through the internet.</p>
<h2><strong><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21870" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Icons-1-1.png" alt="How does a payment gateway work" width="1265" height="461" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Icons-1-1.png 1265w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Icons-1-1-300x109.png 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Icons-1-1-768x280.png 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Icons-1-1-1024x373.png 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Icons-1-1-700x255.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1265px) 100vw, 1265px" /></strong></h2>
<h2><strong>How Does a Payment Gateway Works?</strong></h2>
<p>Payment gateways, specifically the online payment gateways, are front-end technologies that transfer the customer’s financial information to the merchant’s (seller) bank where the transaction is then made.</p>
<p>Here’s a detailed look into how a payment gateway works with each step broken down.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21871" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Icons-2.png" alt="How does a payment gateway work" width="1265" height="464" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Icons-2.png 1265w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Icons-2-300x110.png 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Icons-2-768x282.png 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Icons-2-1024x376.png 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Icons-2-700x257.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1265px) 100vw, 1265px" />Bingo, we now have a good understanding of what a payment gateway is and how its system bridges a financial model between the buyer and the seller.</p>
<p>The question now arises, what are some of the best payment gateways in Pakistan. Let’s find out by dividing the payment gateways available in Pakistan into different categories.</p>
<h2><strong>Best Payment Gateways in Pakistan – Banks </strong></h2>
<p>Thinking of transactions, money, and selling/buying the very first thing that comes to mind are banks.</p>

<p>With wooCommerce, you have to do most of the work yourself as it is not a hosted platform. It can be a little puzzling for you especially in case you&#8217;re a first-time builder. In any case, utilizing a facilitating hosting supplier like Bluehost can make the procedure a ton simpler. It assists you with features such as auto install, SSL certificate, and free domain name. It demands a certain level of knowledge or skills as it’s more technical than shopify.</p>
<p><strong><img class="aligncenter wp-image-20911 size-full" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/woocommerce-ease-of-use.png" alt="Woocommerce for WordPress" width="994" height="469" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/woocommerce-ease-of-use.png 994w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/woocommerce-ease-of-use-300x142.png 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/woocommerce-ease-of-use-768x362.png 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/woocommerce-ease-of-use-700x330.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 994px) 100vw, 994px" /></strong></p>

<h3><strong>4. Pricing</strong></h3>
	<div class="vc_empty_space"  style="height: 22px" ><span
			class="vc_empty_space_inner">
			<span class="empty_space_image"  ></span>
		</span></div>


<p>Woocommerce is free but it holds extra costs such as domain name, hosting, and security. In the case of woocommerce, it becomes difficult to predict your monthly billing. You will have to invest a lot of your time in the pricing which might act as a drawback.</p>
<table class="table">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="101"><strong>Software </strong></td>
<td width="75"><strong>Sub-domain </strong></td>
<td width="124"><strong>Hosting </strong></td>
<td width="146"><strong>SSL certificate </strong></td>
<td width="126"><strong>Top level domain </strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="101">0$</td>
<td width="75">N/A</td>
<td width="124">$5-$100/m (via 3rd party)</td>
<td width="146">Free to $100+/ year (via 3rd party)</td>
<td width="126">$9+/year (via 3rd party)</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>In woocommerce, as the additional extensions come with a price tag, you will need to be more watchful that you are not crossing your budget limits.</p>
<h3><strong>4. Security</strong></h3>
	<div class="vc_empty_space"  style="height: 22px" ><span
			class="vc_empty_space_inner">
			<span class="empty_space_image"  ></span>
		</span></div>


<p>Elevated level security ought to be a need for any site. It&#8217;s particularly significant for online stores, as you&#8217;re not just handling the money of the customers, you&#8217;re additionally holding their data or information. WooCommerce, then again, works with WordPress and is thusly self-hosted. The actual plugin does not offer built in security so it should be taken care of by yourself or by the hosting provider.</p>
<h3><strong>6. Payment Options</strong></h3>
	<div class="vc_empty_space"  style="height: 22px" ><span
			class="vc_empty_space_inner">
			<span class="empty_space_image"  ></span>
		</span></div>


<p>You do not get any woocommerce specific gateway for payment. There are Stripe and PayPal that act as add-ons that can be embedded directly in your store. Subsequently, you&#8217;ll have the option to process transactions appropriately without guiding customers to other 3rd party checkout pages.</p>
<p><strong><img class="aligncenter wp-image-20913 size-full" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/woocomerce-payments.png" alt="Woocmmerce payment options" width="1013" height="632" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/woocomerce-payments.png 1013w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/woocomerce-payments-300x187.png 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/woocomerce-payments-768x479.png 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/woocomerce-payments-700x437.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1013px) 100vw, 1013px" /></strong></p>

		</span></div>


<p>Concluding, each of the platforms includes the benefits for specific situations. In the event where you prefer ownership and flexibility – WooCommerce is presumably your most logical option. On the off chance where you want to go for simplicity &#8211;Shopify is presumably the one for you.</p>
<p>Have a look at a quick comparison of both:</p>

<p>Answering these basic questions can help you in figuring out the options in a better way.</p>
<p>Let’s move towards the comparison between the two e-commerce platforms.</p>
<h2><strong>Magento VS OpenCart: Which One is Better?</strong></h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-20864 size-full" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/magneto-vs-open-cart4.jpg" alt="Magento VS OpenCart" width="1365" height="823" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/magneto-vs-open-cart4.jpg 1365w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/magneto-vs-open-cart4-300x181.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/magneto-vs-open-cart4-768x463.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/magneto-vs-open-cart4-1024x617.jpg 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/magneto-vs-open-cart4-700x422.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1365px) 100vw, 1365px" /></p>
<p>In order to drive a conclusion between <a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/magento-development-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">magento development service</a> and that of OpenCart, we&#8217;d have to look at every aspect of each of the two e-commerce platforms in detail.</p>

	<div class="vc_empty_space"  style="height: 22px" ><span
			class="vc_empty_space_inner">
			<span class="empty_space_image"  ></span>

<p>Magento and OpenCart share plenty of similarities.</p>
<ul>
<li>Generally, they are both open sources that are at last intended to encourage e-commerce businesses.</li>
<li>Both are developed using PHP</li>
<li>Several add-ons and extensions</li>
<li>Multilingual support</li>
<li>Allows recurring payments</li>

		</span></div>


<p>It’s time to analyze both on certain features such as pricing, community support, usage, and features, security, and user interface.</p>
<h3><strong>Pricing</strong></h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-20865 size-full" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/pricing.jpg" alt="Magento &amp; OpenCart Pricing" width="1366" height="501" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/pricing.jpg 1366w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/pricing-300x110.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/pricing-768x282.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/pricing-1024x376.jpg 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/pricing-700x257.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1366px) 100vw, 1366px" /></p>
<p>Magento has two editions: Magento open source- community edition and Magento commerce- enterprise.</p>
<p>Magneto open source is a free platform whereas Magento commerce comes with two plans</p>
<ul>
<li>Magento commerce starter- $1,999/m</li>
<li>Magento commerce pro &#8211; $3,399/m</li>
</ul>
	<div class="vc_empty_space"  style="height: 22px" ><span
			class="vc_empty_space_inner">
			<span class="empty_space_image"  ></span>
		</span></div>


<p>It is also said that price of the enterprise edition of Magento ranges from $22,000 to $32,000 per year. It is quite costly for small businesses to afford.</p>
<p>OpenCart is also free. It’s free to install and then upgrade it. It can be downloaded from the official website and to avail additional features, it requires an extra amount.</p>
<p>With a recent upgrade, it offers two plans</p>
<ul>
<li>Premium support plan- $99/m</li>
<li>One time fix pricing varies – price varies</li>
</ul>
	<div class="vc_empty_space"  style="height: 22px" ><span
			class="vc_empty_space_inner">
			<span class="empty_space_image"  ></span>
		</span></div>


<h3><strong>User Interface</strong></h3>
<p><strong><img class="aligncenter wp-image-20866 size-full" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/user-interface.jpg" alt="User-Interface Comparison between Magento &amp; OpenCart" width="1366" height="501" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/user-interface.jpg 1366w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/user-interface-300x110.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/user-interface-768x282.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/user-interface-1024x376.jpg 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/user-interface-700x257.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1366px) 100vw, 1366px" /></strong></p>
<p>Magento comes with a steep learning curve and is not easier to handle for a beginner with all the packages and its features. To deal with its user interface, you might have to hire specialists. In Magento, it is easier to navigate the sidebar and it also has written documentation for the support and help for the users.</p>
<p>OpenCart has quite a simple user interface with ease of installation and setting it up. It is easier to navigate the sidebar. Moreover, you can download different extensions and modify the designs using the tabs in the admin panel.  It also has a presentable statistical data.</p>
<h3><strong>Community Support </strong></h3>
<p><strong><img class="aligncenter wp-image-20867 size-full" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/comunity-support.jpg" alt="Community Support in Magento &amp; OpenCart" width="1366" height="501" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/comunity-support.jpg 1366w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/comunity-support-300x110.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/comunity-support-768x282.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/comunity-support-1024x376.jpg 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/comunity-support-700x257.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1366px) 100vw, 1366px" /></strong></p>
<p>Both Magento and OpenCart have settled networks that offer help and guidance by request, yet clearly, the community support of Magento is unmistakably and progressively vigorous. Magento additionally ensures and prescribes the developers to concede them with believability, which makes it simple to channel the guidance you get and know who you ought to tune in to.</p>
<h3><strong>Security </strong></h3>
<p><strong><img class="aligncenter wp-image-20868 size-full" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/security.jpg" alt="Security Comparison of Magento &amp; OpenCart" width="1366" height="501" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/security.jpg 1366w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/security-300x110.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/security-768x282.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/security-1024x376.jpg 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/security-700x257.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1366px) 100vw, 1366px" /></strong></p>
<p>Presently security is an enormous concern. When utilizing an e-commerce platform, it is extremely fundamental to ensure the protection of customer’s information who are doing online payments.</p>
<p>For Magento, security is very crucial. It keeps on offering regular updates with better security patches and many extensions. As it is an open-source, it is required to add extensions and follow proper guidelines to make it more secure.</p>
<p>OpenCart is not a complicated platform and is not much vulnerable to breach. It has a self-defense system with written documents to follow the security guidelines properly.</p>
<h3><strong>Features and Usage </strong></h3>
<p><strong><img class="aligncenter wp-image-20869 size-full" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/features.jpg" alt="Features of Magento &amp; OpenCart" width="1366" height="501" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/features.jpg 1366w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/features-300x110.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/features-768x282.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/features-1024x376.jpg 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/features-700x257.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1366px) 100vw, 1366px" /></strong></p>

<p>Every feature is already available on Magento and other additional features can be generated by the developers or experts on your demand.  In case you&#8217;re not a Magento expert or in the event that you do not have the knowledge of PHP, you&#8217;ll most likely discover Magento a piece excessively complicated, particularly with regards to using its features and flexibility.</p>
<p>OpenCart is a way easier platform and is extraordinary for small companies that need to deliver rapidly without numerous integrations. It gives a strong shopping basket and some incredible tools which are instinctive and straight forward, to such an extent that some experts may think that it’s excessively oversimplified, with insufficient features to play with.</p>
<p>According to ecommerce platforms, here is the list of the most used ecommerce platforms (Data Source: BuiltWith)</p>
<ul>
<li>Magento</li>
<li>Shopify</li>
<li>WooCoomerce</li>
<li>BigCommerce</li>
<li>Wix</li>
<li>Weebly</li>
<li>SquareSpace</li>

<p>Magento ecommerce can bolster sites of any size. Stores that expect high traffic and more exchanges do float towards Magento 2 since it can scale up or down to help all business conditions. Indeed, even as your business develops, it can deal with every one of your necessities. OpenCart will in general suit little to medium size sites that don&#8217;t anticipate a lot of traffic.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>E-commerce business is on the hype and it is continuing to grow. Startups find it easier to set up an online business than to open local outlets; it is costlier, and the money instead can be baked in online strategies to have a well-promoted brand within months.</p>
<p>The emerging technology has boosted online shopping to a great level due to increased mobile and other digital device usages, also allowing many <strong><a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/">digital marketing agencies</a></strong> to take birth.</p>
<p>Social media has become one of the mainstream platforms when it comes to market through online mediums; giving an immense boost to e-commerce businesses generating high traffic, high brand awareness and customer base, but the actual question stands is <strong>Does it also increase the conversation rate?</strong> <a href="https://totempool.com/blog/digital-marketing-for-dummies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Driving more traffic</a> to your eCommerce website doesn’t mean a high conversion rate, and this is where your product(s), brand image, market standing etc., plays a role which we will talk below.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>How to Improve the Conversion Rate</strong></h2>
<p>Before we start, you might be wondering what the optimal conversion rate is, well mostly businesses have seen a 1% rate or 2% rate, and this is most common. However, if you find your rate at 2% then your business is in a good position. Let’s talk about the factors that boost the conversion rate.</p>
<h3><strong>1. Play with Your Product Images</strong></h3>
<p>It is essential for e-commerce to provide the entire book of its products and most importantly do add images of each one of your product from various angles.</p>
<p>Wouldn’t you like if you have the option to analyze product from each and every angle in detail but do make sure these images provided are of high quality.</p>
<p>Add features like zoom in, rotate the image on a 360 degree and much more.</p>
<h3><strong>2. Provide Cost-Free Shipping</strong></h3>
<p>Now as there are growing online businesses, the competitor base is becoming intense, therefore, giving your customers, such services will be a great conversation rate booster.</p>
<p>Customers are becoming more and more aware; hence use this strategy to reduce killing the conversion.</p>
<p>To improve the conversion rate, even more, keeping everything else amazing and according to the customer’s perception, is to provide a service called “cash on delivery”. This will surely generate trust about your brand and can be a competitive advantage.</p>
<h3><strong>3. Product Detail</strong></h3>
<p>The image is an interest developing tool but to really let consumer’s come to a decision, the real game is played by the product description.</p>
<p>The description should provide well-structured and detailed information of the product so that it is conceived by the customers that the product is right for them.</p>
<p>Note that, using false information of the product may enable users to purchase the product but it will surely damage the long term relation and brand image. Moreover, copying the manufacturer’s product detail will have a negative impact on your brand, also resulting in poor search engine optimization.</p>
<h3><strong>4. Product Customization </strong></h3>
<p>Want to improve the conversion rate? Then make sure the customers are given the feel as if they are shopping in real. They should be allowed to visualize products in different colors, design and much more.</p>
<p>Some <a href="https://www.softwaredevelopmentcompany.co/ecommerce-software-development-companies/">top ecommerce development companies</a> who create e-commerce websites, like for instance an eyeglass brand, allows you to take a selfie so that you could put different shades and be 100% sure about which one’s going to suit your face shape and features.</p>
<p>Isn’t it amazing how you could analyze your real look just by sitting at home without even physically trying it out?</p>
<h3><strong>5. Product Pricing</strong></h3>
<p>Internet and social media have provided customers with perfect knowledge about the market therefore, it has become highly recommendable that businesses should use competitive pricing if providing homogeneous products, because the price will act as a real driver for customers’ decision in a highly competitive market.</p>
<p>Quality and brand name also matters when deciding to purchase a product, therefore, customers’ willingness to pay will rise and so pricing strategies should reflect the quality and brand image.</p>
<h3><strong>6. Employ Cart Abandonment Software</strong></h3>
<p>This software works best for e-commerce sites where the customers leave the site after putting the product in the cart without completing the order.</p>
<p>The software will help the business in a way that when a customer adds an item to the cart and leaves without checking out, he/she has to provide their email and other details, with the provided information, follow-up emails can be sent with cart item details to the customers giving them incentives like discount coupons which may enable them to complete the purchase.</p>
<p>This strategy can really boost up the business’s sales and develop a strong customer base!</p>
<h3><strong>7. Provide the Best User Experience</strong></h3>
<p>It has been seen as a conversion rate booster because generate a high image and reputation of your brand, customers should be given the best user experience such as a high-quality web design; proper tabs to search for products easily, well-structured navigation bar etc. Well, in short, a clutter-free website for the customers to surf on.</p>
<p>Just imagine you entered a clothing outlet and found that the lightning and the interior is not good with having untidy racks, will it ever generate an image for the brand? Will your perception about the products’ quality be reduced by at least 50%?</p>
<h3><strong>8. Allow Customers to Make Purchases via Various Mediums</strong></h3>
<p>Customers may be just one click away from making a purchase but because your e-commerce site didn’t provide them with different payment options, the purchase might have not taken place.</p>
<p>Adding PayPal, credit cards and other payment methods can improve the conversion rate as many customers might do online transactions through for instance We Pay, but it was not available on your site and so the customer couldn’t purchase and therefore didn’t.</p>
<p>Allowing various known online payment methods will also raise the trust level for your brand.</p>
<h3><strong>9. Live Chats/Chat Bots</strong></h3>
<p>This will work similar to as having a salesperson for your eCommerce business; any hassle caused can thus be solved using live chats so that they are assisted by a person who knows best about the brand products.</p>
<p>A new technical way where bots are integrated with live chats, available 24/7, and can provide even better customer service and assist them with a detail information of the answers asked.</p>
<h3><strong>10. Use Product Videos</strong></h3>
<p>You can add videos as well along with your product’s images, which may include, how your product is developed, what materials are used, a small guide on how to you use the product.</p>
<p>Visual Content will enhance the way a product is perceived in the minds of the customers and better explain about the product, which may lead to more conversions.</p>
<h3><strong>11. Add Customers’ Reviews About the Products</strong></h3>
<p>Customers would feel more secure when purchasing a product from your site if the reviews are added up with the product details and in some case scenario, few online businesses add comments as well.</p>
<p>The first thing customers look for before purchasing any item online is to make sure the reviews go in line with the product details because normally the product is not that good but the image quality and description makes it look like a high-quality product.</p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Social Media is one of the largest platforms to interact with your audience and share your content. Millions of people check in daily which makes it possible to have your ideas shared with just one click to thousands of people at one time.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.buzzinteractive.co/">Digital Marketing Agencies</a></strong> rely heavily on Social Networking Sites for e-commerce business promotions as they have known that this is the fastest way to be dominant in the market; engage with thousands of audience, convert users into potential customers, and build brand recognition.</p>
<p>Facebook is the first name that comes into the minds of marketers when talking about marketing their brand but each social media site has different strategies and helps different businesses in their dealings.</p>
<h3><strong>1. Fully Consider Networks for Your Kind of Business</strong></h3>
<p>As we have mentioned above, Facebook is not the only medium to promote your business, different networks are used for different brand type. Let’s talk about it.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Facebook</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>One of the largest platforms for brand recognition, it is used for any brand type and can prove to be the fastest and the largest customer base booster. Most importantly e-commerce businesses can see a great improvement in their brand awareness.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Instagram</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The largest platform for businesses that depend heavily on images like clothing etc., many growing clothing brands are using Instagram to boost up their customers.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pinterest</strong><strong><br />
</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>A great source to shout out for your brand like Jewelry etc., because research has shown many women are seen on this social media platform.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Google+</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Need to reach people in the technology industry? Join Google+ communities and share your ideas, products and much more.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>LinkedIn</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Are you a manufacturer and looking to be a supplier for other businesses? Then this platform is a good source for you to reach out to other businesses, which is called B2B marketing.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h3><strong>2. </strong><strong>Share Valuable and Interesting Content</strong></h3>
<p>Social Media is all about building a relationship with your audience so share contents that are relevant yet interesting. It is important to have your audience engage with you and share your post because priority is given to have your brand recognized.</p>
<p>Value content will allow you to engage with existing customers and attract new customers enabling them to link to your brand as it means something to them. Valuable content can include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Promotions such as discounts for your product/service</li>
<li>Shouting out about any new product launch</li>
<li>Sharing helpful information that is related to your business</li>
</ul>
<p>There needs to be a balance when sharing posts, the audience would not like to see serious topics all the time they get a post from your page on their news feeds, a little humor will keep your audience active and revive their energy.</p>
<p>Memes are trendy and can work as a good way to get your audience to share the post and tag others. Note that, always share contents that come in compliance with your brand image.</p>
<p>Visual content proves to be the most engaging; almost all the businesses are working on sharing images and videos. Hiring Digital Agency for <strong><a href="http://www.buzzinteractive.co/">social media promotion</a></strong> is becoming common as posts are professionally designed because they reflect your brand image. Using a gif image is another way to visually attract customers.</p>
<h3><strong>3. Use Promotional Campaigns</strong></h3>
<p>New brands on social media are like a small piece of a puzzle, and it is really difficult to reach thousands of customers organically; it is not impossible but it may take time.</p>
<p>The best part about social media is that you can spend the little amount of money to get your content a mega boost in reaching your targeted audience.</p>
<p>Campaigns are intended to give incentives to your audience which will enable user participation.</p>
<p>Contests can be carried once or twice a month and rewards can be given, e.g. if you are a cookware business, you may decide to give a free deep cooking pot to the winner, this will not only help people engage with your brand but will also allow the customers to try out your product which can generate future sales.</p>
<h3><strong>4. Market Segmentation</strong></h3>
<p>Social Media sites are really effective in reaching out to audiences for your kind of business. It is however important because potential clients are only the ones who can relate themselves to your product.</p>
<p>Now it is easy as you can reach out specific targets by segmenting for your type of brand according to location, age, gender, interests and much more.</p>
<h3><strong>5. Customer Experience and Service</strong></h3>
<p>One of the most important parts of the social media site, customers really take the behavior of businesses into account and that attracts them the most.</p>
<p>The quality that customers are provided with sets an impression for your brand online; try to give your customer with all possible information about your brand including your location, phone number, website link etc. Nowadays social media sites are the largest platform used by people to acquire any e-commerce business’s information, therefore, you should provide the best customer experience.</p>
<p>Customer service really helps you improve your customer base, establish long term relations and much more. A good service given to your customer works as a “<strong>word-of-mouth” </strong>from the customer satisfied by your service will market you all over his/her social networking<strong>,</strong> and it is a good strategy to improve your brand image and awareness. Provide full information about the product that you have posted on your social media page e.g. price, quality and all possible details of your product.</p>
<p>Let’s say you entered an outlet, e.g. clothing, and all shirts are hanged without a price tag or the size, what impression will it generate?</p>
<p>Social Media is just like an online outlet for your brand, therefore, customer service should not be overlooked.</p>
<p>Other ways to provide customers with the best experience is to be really active, deal with their queries really fast, always check for your inbox and reply them quickly.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Summing up the informative Session</strong></h2>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/social-media-services/">Social Media Marketing</a></strong> is the best and most cost-effective way to get your e-commerce business a great boost in its sales, brand image, brand awareness, brand recognition, and customer base.</p>
<p>You can sell your products all over the world at any place and to any person and not just in your local surroundings, furthermore consumers would pay even a little extra money to get products right at their doorstep, therefore an online business with well-established links on social media is the best strategy to look into.</p>
