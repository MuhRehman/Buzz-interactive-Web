								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Website development and design practices have gone through a lot of changes in the way we see them today. Nowadays, developing a website is also a matter of being creative and trendy than just having the technical knowledge.</p>



<p>According to Netcraft’s web server survey in January 2019, there are over 1 billion websites on the World Wide Web. And this whopping number of websites is increasing every second.</p>



<p>This literally means that there is 1 website for every 7 people on the planet. And that’s already a lot of websites.</p>



<p>For this reason, there is growing need for applying different tactics and techniques so that your website can stand out among so many others. Today, businesses and individual website owners have to go a step further in making their websites more advanced and personalized to the audience they are trying to attract.</p>



<p>So talking about the upcoming future trends in web design and development industry in 2020, web developers are required to keep up with a myriad of technological as well as design related trends.</p>



<h1><strong>Progressive Web Apps</strong></h1>



<p>Progressive Web Applications or PWAs are increasingly becoming popular among web developers and users.</p>



<p>A Progressive Web App or PWA is an application software. Or you can simply put that a PWA is a website that gives the look and feel of a native mobile app.Popular examples of progressive web apps are: Uber, Pinterest, MakeMyTrip, Twitter Lite and others.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img class="wp-image-19892" src="https://static1.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/uber.jpg" alt="" width="565" height="376" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/uber.jpg 700w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/uber-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 565px) 100vw, 565px" />

</figure>
</div>



<p style="text-align: center;"> </p>



<p>Plus, you don’t necessarily have to download a PWA in your mobile phone &#8211; while you enjoy the ease of programming of a website. In PWAs, you get to access all the information and modern capabilities as you do in a mobile app.</p>



<p>Moreover, the modern features of PWAs are supported by majority of the web browsers. Meaning that every business can start to launch a website that’s smooth, swift, and app-like in its feel.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img class="wp-image-19893" src="https://static.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/starbucks-1024x1024.jpg" alt="" width="446" height="446" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/starbucks-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/starbucks-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/starbucks-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/starbucks-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/starbucks-570x570.jpg 570w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/starbucks-500x500.jpg 500w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/starbucks-1000x1000.jpg 1000w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/starbucks-700x700.jpg 700w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/starbucks.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 446px) 100vw, 446px" />

</div>



<p style="text-align: center;"> </p>



<p>For these reasons, <a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/web-development-services/">PWA web development</a> is going to remain a popular choice in 2020 and beyond.</p>



<p>It’s important to state here that most of the well-known companies have experienced a significant growth in their user engagement. And increase in user engagement gave them high conversion rates upon using PWAs.</p>



<p>Take the example of <strong>Twitter Lite</strong> as a good case in point. Twitter had realized that they needed an app that worked on every device, and loaded quickly. As it had to engage a whopping 380 million audience at that time, Twitter introduced its PWA version in the form of Twitter Lite.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img class="wp-image-19930" src="https://static2.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/twitter-mobile.jpg" alt="Twitter mobile" width="566" height="377" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/twitter-mobile.jpg 623w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/twitter-mobile-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 566px) 100vw, 566px" />
<figcaption><br />Image Credit: Twitter Lite</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>



<p style="text-align: center;"> </p>



<p>The results achieved were incredible! Twitter experienced:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>★ 65% increase in pages per session</p>
<p>★ 75% increase in Tweets sent</p>
<p>★ And a 20% decrease in bounce rates</p>
</blockquote>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<h3> </h3>



<h3><strong>Benefits</strong></h3>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>➝ <strong>App-like experience:</strong> Makes easy for your users to access your content &#8211; so they keep coming back.</p>
<p>➝ <strong>Faster loading time:</strong> Decreases the bounce rate (users clicking away from website after viewing only one page).</p>
<p>➝ <strong>Better UX:</strong> Engages users, which allows them to stay on your website for long.</p>
<p>➝ <strong>Lesser consumption:</strong> Internet data is consumed less.</p>
<p>➝ <strong>Increased Sales:</strong> Happy and engaged users increase conversion rates.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>UX Design</strong></h3>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Talking about a <a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/design-services/">UX design website</a>, there is cut-throat competition among websites in the online world. User experience or UX refers to the overall experience of a user looking at your website in terms of how easy and pleasing it is to use.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-19895" src="https://static3.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ux-design.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ux-design.jpg 600w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ux-design-300x150.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" />

</figure>
</div>



<p style="text-align: center;"> </p>



<p>But why are UX design best practices becoming so much of a grave concern for almost every website owner?</p>



<p>It’s because users these days are super impatient in their online behaviour. A user today, according to <a href="https://allisonjedwards.com/the-attention-span-crisis-and-what-it-means-for-kids/" rel="nofollow">research</a>, can focus on a web page for just 8 seconds. This raises the chance of more users clicking away if you are not optimizing your UX design.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img class="wp-image-19896" src="https://static2.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/human.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="469" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/human.jpg 712w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/human-300x281.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/human-700x657.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></figure>
</div>



<p>So the more your website page visuals and style click the minds of the users, the more they enjoy checking it out.</p>



<p>A lot more focus will be on making the UX design more relevant to the taste of target audience in 2020. So that it reduces friction, and saves time of users.</p>



<p>Some important UX design best practices you should consider include:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>★ Personalize website according to your target audience.</p>
<p>★ Light popups suggesting tips to users to speed up their action taking.</p>
<p>★ Features should be visible only when a user needs to see them in a specific context.</p>
<p>★ Simple changes like placement of navigation bar, non-irritating presentation of adverts, and avoidance of distracting popups can work wonders.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Benefits</strong></h3>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>➝ <strong>Increase in Revenue:</strong>  75% of people think of a website based on its overall aesthetics. Organically increasing the engagement of users through awesome UX design is a good way of ensuring long-term increase in sales. Rather than depending on just advertising for boosting short term sales.</p>
<p>➝ <strong>Low Costs:</strong> Applying UX design approach in website development cuts a lot of costs.</p>
<p>➝ <strong>UX Design Increases Customer Loyalty:</strong> Positively engaging experiences bind users to your product. This keeps them coming back for more.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Chatbots</strong></h2>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Chatbots are empowered through Artificial Intelligence (AI). They simply help users to share their queries which they otherwise would enquire from a human customer service representative.</p>



<p>While the owner is away taking care of other things, AI helps bots solve problems and interact in a human like style with customers.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img class="wp-image-19898" src="https://static2.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/chatbox.png" alt="" width="463" height="400" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/chatbox.png 832w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/chatbox-300x260.png 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/chatbox-768x665.png 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/chatbox-700x606.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 463px) 100vw, 463px" /></figure>
</div>



<p>Due to its popularity and acceptance among internet users, more and more companies are opting for interactive chatbots on their websites. This demand for AI powered technology performing multitasking will see a rapid increase throughout 2020.</p>



<p>Furthermore, big companies are making financial investments to enable AI bots with complex thinking and negotiation capacity like that of humans. These AI chatbots now seem to take over the messaging industry with their multipurpose role capabilities.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image">

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote is-style-default" style="border-color: #abb8c3;">
<blockquote>
<p>“Google analysts also believe that next year, 2020, robots will be smart enough so that mimic complex behavior of humans like flirting and jokes”</p>
<cite> (Source: Accenture)</cite></blockquote>
</figure>



<h3><strong>Benefits</strong></h3>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>➝ <strong>Accessible anytime: </strong>People spend around 7 minutes until they are assigned to a CSR. Chatbots are replacing slower communication methods like emails, phone calls and live chat.</p>
<p>➝ <strong>Handling capacity:</strong> can communicate with thousands of humans at the same time.</p>
<p>➝ <strong>Satisfied Customers:</strong> Chatbots are not prone to emotions like human beings. They follow only what they are programmed to do. Bots also retain the user’s order history like address, name, number and other preferences &#8211; making transactions very simple and fast.</p>
<p>➝ <strong>Cost effectivity:</strong> You don’t have to pay a salary to a chatbot.</p>
<p>➝ <strong>Customer Data Recording:</strong> Bots are able to record consumer behaviour and their purchasing patterns. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ajagrawal/2016/07/13/7-ways-chatbot-tools-are-important-for-marketing/#3c4b4230602e">Forbes</a> says that this capacity helps any company to decide “which products to market differently, which to market more and which to redevelop for relaunch”. In this way, more personalized services to the consumer are achieved.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Minimalist Approach to Web Design</strong></h3>



<p>Another growing trend in web development is the need to prefer simplicity over visual splendour.</p>



<p>Neatly designed websites tend to gather more user appeal. So the practice of complimenting high quality visuals with minimalism and clean-design solutions is a great way of growing user appeal. It’s better if you hire a professional <a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/web-development-services/">web design and development company</a> that fully caters to all your business’s requisite needs.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img class="wp-image-19900" src="https://static.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/nerds-1024x497.jpg" alt="" width="549" height="266" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/nerds-1024x497.jpg 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/nerds-300x146.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/nerds-768x373.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/nerds-700x340.jpg 700w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/nerds.jpg 1347w" sizes="(max-width: 549px) 100vw, 549px" />
<figcaption>Image Credit: <a href="https://nerds.company/">Nerds</a></figcaption>
</figure>
</div>



<p>Further focus is on writing personalized and simple worded content that engages users into exploring more about your brand.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img class="wp-image-19914" src="https://static3.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/the-law-practice.png" alt="new law practice" width="616" height="276" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/the-law-practice.png 697w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/the-law-practice-300x135.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 616px) 100vw, 616px" /></figure>
</div>



<p>This practice was started by the Microsoft Corporation in its OS development preferences. Where Microsoft began creating easy to navigate UIs (user interface) and proper placement of touchscreen ready elements.</p>



<h3><strong>Benefits</strong></h3>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>➝ <strong>Ranking &amp; Traffic:</strong> Google and other search engines rank your website to a higher position. And with better ranking and a neat website, you will get more and more traffic and leads.</p>
<p>➝ <strong>Loading Span: </strong>Web page loading speed is accelerated.</p>
<p>➝ <strong>Less Burdenizing:</strong> Clean UI and navigation lower CPU’s requirements and lower the bandwidth too.</p>
<p>➝ <strong>User engagement:</strong> Better accessibility will let more users to be engaged on your website. Web</p>
</blockquote>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Single Page Applications</strong></h3>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p>A Single Page Application is a website that fits on a single page. The main goal of sticking to a single page style is to make the user experience effortlessly smooth.</p>



<p>Having said that, the old way of surfing a website’s pages is slow. It’s that whenever you want to go to a certain web page on the browser, each page takes time to separately load and then shows up.</p>



<p>Conversely, what SPAs do is that they instantly download all the web pages at the backend in the form of a file. In this way, SPAs save you from reloading any pages. As a result, scrolling through many pages becomes a matter of seconds for users.</p>



<p>The inconvenience of long page loading time is now being replaced by a growing trend in the development of SPAs in web development.</p>



<p>Because they are fast and easy to navigate, more companies are joining the race to create better SPA style websites for their users.</p>



<p>And so the SPAs here to stay in 2020 and beyond.</p>



<p>Remarkable examples of popular SPAs include:</p>



<p>Gmail …</p>



<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img class="wp-image-19911" src="https://static3.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/new-gmail-1024x495.png" alt="New gmail" width="604" height="291" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/new-gmail-1024x495.png 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/new-gmail-300x145.png 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/new-gmail-768x371.png 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/new-gmail-700x338.png 700w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/new-gmail.png 1202w" sizes="(max-width: 604px) 100vw, 604px" /></figure>

<p>Twitter …</p>



<div class="wp-block-image">

<p style="text-align: center;"> </p>



<p>And others.</p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Benefits</strong></h3>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>➝ <strong>Fast &amp; Swift:</strong> No need to reload pages again and again.</p>
<p>➝ <strong>User Friendly Readability:</strong> SPAs have designs that visually appeal to the sight. More appeal means increased conversion rates. When you better engage users, they always return to your website and are likely to purchase a product/service.</p>
<p>➝ <strong>Cost Effective:</strong> They are relatively cheap to develop and easy to set.</p>
<p>➝ <strong>High Performance:</strong> The overall performance is always better as less bandwidth is required by SPAs.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>AI Content Curation</strong></h3>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p>The true merit of a website is measured by its content. This fact cannot be emphasized enough.</p>



<p>Content is simply “the king” in user engagement.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img class="wp-image-19905" src="https://static.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/triberr-1024x575.jpg" alt="" width="563" height="315" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/triberr-1024x575.jpg 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/triberr-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/triberr-700x393.jpg 700w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/triberr-539x303.jpg 539w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/triberr.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 563px) 100vw, 563px" />
<figcaption>Image Credit: <a href="https://blog.triberr.com/">triberr</a></figcaption>
</figure>
</div>



<p style="text-align: center;"> </p>



<p>Artificial Intelligence based content curation rules the roost in the upcoming future. AI algorithms will soon take over the process of content curation just as AI chatbots look after human queries.</p>



<p>So how will this happen?</p>



<p>An example can that be of a professional painter. While surfing the web, a painter won’t necessarily be interested in a lifestyle blog or an SEO blog, right? In such situations, AI will automatically be triggered to place painting related content on the forefront.</p>



<p>Websites will thus be developed and optimized in such a way in 2020 and beyond for more intelligent responses.</p>



<p>Moreover, users can also opt-out of these settings to have a more hands-on approach for filtering their content.</p>



<h3><strong>Benefits</strong></h3>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>➝ Automatic content selection and generation meaning better matched content for user.</p>
<p>➝ Easier time for users in finding relevant content..</p>
<p>➝ Personalized content for chatbots.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Motion UI</strong></h3>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p>If they say a picture is worth a thousand words. Then how would it be like if a picture moved and transitioned too? Motion UI technology allows you to do just that!</p>



<p>In simple words, a motion UI is a combination of transitioning pieces of animation to make things appear on a website as if they are moving. Developers are now focusing on motion UI for developing websites to make them look more appealing to the users.</p>



<p>Motion UI will soon be a high in demand web development trend because of its:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>★ High potential of usability</p>
<p>★ Modern animations</p>
<p>★ Dynamic visual graphics</p>
<p>★ The storytelling style of presentation</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It allows developers to use a wide range of tools and techniques. So that they can better engage target audience’s attention. Research claims that the average time span of human attention is even less than that of a goldfish.</p>



<p>That being said, today’s users have gotten super bored with hundreds and thousands of similar looking websites on the internet. Old static designs don’t visually appeal to their senses as much as they did in the year 2000 since attention spans are suffering.</p>



<p>That is where motion web UI comes into play. Motion UI’s captivating visuals are an awesome way of getting users to not get bored and pay attention.</p>



<p>Now if you’re successful in getting the user’s attention through motion UI, you can further engage them with your content. So you can turn these engaged users into qualified quality leads for your business.</p>



<h3><strong>Benefits</strong></h3>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>➝ <strong>Low Cost:</strong> It’s created by relatively small sized teams and its development is not costly.</p>
<p>➝ <strong>Always Fresh:</strong> Your site will never look old as designs get easily updated.</p>
<p>➝ <strong>Memorable:</strong> Beautifully captivating click the minds of your target audience so much that they tend to remember your website when they leave.</p>
<p>➝ <strong>More Leads:</strong> Memorable and engaging websites make users to make a purchase decision today or tomorrow as they remember your website.</p>
<p>➝ <strong>Lively Impression:</strong> A huge variety of innovative tactics can be applied that engage you more users.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Internet Of Things</strong></h3>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p>The term IoT or Internet of Things refers to all the electronic devices as a whole that can connect to the internet. Meaning any device that is connectable to the internet will fall in the IoT category.</p>

<p>IoT has applications in health care, smart cities, agriculture, wearable’s, smart home appliances with many other possibilities.</p>



<p>Now you must be wondering what IoT has to do with website development? Let me explain:</p>



<p>A lot of Internet of Things devices can display website content on them. Popular examples include smart appliances, UI on TVs, laptops, industrial monitors, smart speakers, smart phones, smart watches and glasses, and so forth.</p>



<p>Moreover, the devices in IoT are connected to one another via the internet, and work with huge amounts of data. IoT web development is therefore different from ordinary web development as it puts more focus on system’s scalability and reliability.</p>



<p>More and more new and diverse devices with web display capability are being developed. Therefore IoT will undeniably be an essential part of web development in 2020 and beyond.</p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We all know trends can be flaky and nowhere it&#8217;s more apparent than web design. What is popular today might not be popular tomorrow. The tides will continue to shift.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there are a few things you can foretell based on where most websites are headed. And if you can successfully do so, you can crush your competition before they even know what hit them.</p>
<p>Gathered are top five innovative web design trends that your online business or <a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/design-services/"><strong>web design agency</strong></a> can follow in 2019:</p>
<h2><strong>The Rise of Playful Cursors</strong></h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-18683 size-full" src="https://static1.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/web-design.gif" alt="web design trends" width="800" height="600" /></p>
<p>The traditional cursor serves just one purpose; get you where you want to go in a blink of an eye with a simple click. For years, it remained a disregarded element on websites because changing it seemed unnecessary to all those providing web design services given that it serves no aesthetic function.</p>
<p>But times are changing. Now more and more websites are opting for interesting and interactive designs, which has opened a new pathway for cursors too.</p>
<p>Most of all, the aesthetics of the cursor are rapidly changing and most of the time it syncs with the style of the web in question. For instance, if it’s a site about photography, your <a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/design-services/"><strong>web design agency</strong></a> might turn the cursor into the center dot of a camera, so you can use it to snap the ‘pictures’ of different parts of the site you want to access.</p>
<p>This means gone are the days of just pointing and clicking. These days, you can even click and hold certain elements to get a video to play or a GIF to load on modern websites.</p>
<p>In fact, you get to see different functions based on whether you hold or click the mouse, giving your web development partner more room to play with interactive parts.</p>
<h2><strong>Screen Dominating Text Set to Rule the Web</strong></h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-18684" src="https://static.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/web-design.jpg" alt="web design trends in 2019" width="800" height="436" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/web-design.jpg 550w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/web-design-300x164.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://sjtyna2014.weebly.com/bibliography.html">Source</a></p>
<p>In 2019, text in web design will continue to thrive under the content first approach. For years, content specialists have argued that content should be at the heart of your strategy when it comes to publishing.</p>
<p>Sure, it seemed obvious in theory, but in practice, people providing <a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/design-services/"><strong>web design services</strong></a> failed to pay heed to this aspect for years. Despite the fact that it’s one of the most important parts of the website.</p>
<p>Fortunately, we’ve stepped in the era where content is pushed to the forefront once again. Companies offering <a href="https://www.softwaredevelopmentcompany.co/software-development-companies/">top software development companies</a> are now reintroduced to the letterforms and websites are giving text center stage.</p>
<p>This welcome change is represented with huge letters on the home page of many websites. Huge fragmented textual messages on web pages instantly grab visitors’ attention, which perfectly serves the purpose of the message being displayed.</p>
<p>Whether it’s a worthwhile message or not, it still makes the visitors feel like it’s something urgent. At times the digital marketing agencies intentionally keep the font too large just to add an additional level of urgency.</p>
<h3><strong>Impactful Black &amp; White With a Cherry on Top</strong></h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-18681 size-full" src="https://static.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/business.jpg" alt="Business trends in 2019" width="850" height="540" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/business.jpg 850w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/business-300x191.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/business-768x488.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/business-700x445.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> <a href="https://webthemez.com/bootstrap-templates-free-download/">Source</a></p>
<p>Colors are something that can change the way people see your website. That’s why picking the right hues for your site is one of the most important things to consider.</p>
<p>People associate different moods with different colors and designers have taken advantage of this since the dawn of the internet. Though getting rid of most colors doesn’t seem like an effective idea, designers are becoming creative with the two most simple colors—black and white.</p>
<p>The two colors have always remained an interesting pair of art. One reflects openness and light, while the other is the absolute opposite, makes you feel imprisoned. Modern websites are leveraging these colors because they feel more professional and also allow the designers to show off their skills.</p>
<p>Lately, this trend has seen a surge, but this time around your digital marketing agency might use them with a minimum of other colors to emphasize something important. For example, gentle shade of red behind an element sticks out like a cherry on top.</p>
<p>Most importantly, using black and white with other colors allows you to grasp the attention of your users the way you like while maintaining the aesthetics.</p>
<h3><strong>Helvetica to Dominate Logo Designs</strong></h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-18682" src="https://static3.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/mailchimp-1024x426.png" alt="mailchimp" width="844" height="351" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/mailchimp-1024x426.png 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/mailchimp-300x125.png 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/mailchimp-768x319.png 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/mailchimp-700x291.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 844px) 100vw, 844px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.zenman.com/blog/best-new-rebrand-logos-2018/" class="broken_link">Source</a></p>
<p>With websites getting more vibrant and intriguing over time, the same can’t be said about website logos. The common logo is now given a new face-lift.</p>
<p>Last year, we witnessed an increase in playful wordmarks to represent the eccentric side of the brands. But this time, they are looking to achieve the minimalistic look of sans-serifs or similar styles. In a few words, every popular brand you see is now getting a Helvetica version of their logo.</p>
<p>While some brands may benefit from this simple approach, others might not be appreciated as much. Because this kind of cold design starts to annoy some people.</p>
<p>This might be a symbol of maturity and growth, but the lack of eccentricity will certainly remove the warmth from certain logos.</p>
<h3><strong>Conclusion </strong></h3>
<p>At times experience tells you what to look for when you are designing a website, while other times you are just following the rising trend. But the most important thing is to always stay ahead of your competition.

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I think I could say this about most people in tech – we are megalomaniacs. We want to build the best and the biggest. We are always designing our apps with scalability in mind. We tend to design for the largest possible audience.</p>
<p>Every app that launches on TechCrunch always addresses a huge market. You never read about a product addressing a small community. It’s always about the app with the biggest dreams going after the largest competitors.</p>
<p>Just take a quick scroll through Dribbble to see my point. It’s filled with generic chat apps and revolutionary social network redesigns – are these really doing anything to develop a designer’s skills?</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://uploads.toptal.io/blog/image/121490/toptal-blog-image-1480432128483-97de956595294cdff8888d1c2e839245.gif" alt="Design " width="304" height="304" /></p>
<div class="pop_out_box is-full_width is-big">I believe that designers take on projects with such an ambitious scale as a result of our egos.</div>
<p>What designers don’t realize though, is that many of the world’s most well-known products didn’t start with global ambitions. Rather, they often addressed a small, local need first and grew from there. Therefore, if you really want to develop your skills and produce a truly creative product, you will be much better off checking your ego and starting small.</p>
<h2 id="stop-inflating-your-ego">Stop Inflating Your Ego</h2>
<p>In the book “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ego-Enemy-Ryan-Holiday/dp/1591847818" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ego is the Enemy</a>,” Ryan Holiday uses past examples of famous figures – both successful and unsuccessful – to illustrate the adverse effects of the ego.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="https://uploads.toptal.io/blog/image/121487/toptal-blog-image-1480406226481-9f79e77ce4f521e2239efe55550b1de8.jpg" alt="ego is the enemy" width="1040" height="693" /></p>
<p>While Holiday writes to all industries, not just design, designers will learn a lot from him.</p>
<p>His book addresses the type of thinking that distracts us from designing a product for a small audience, which helps you and another five people instead of 100 million faceless people who you don’t know personally.</p>
<p>Designing with your ego creates a product that is diluted, unfocused, and just bland. Consider these well-known products that didn’t give into big thinking in the beginning.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><a href="https://www.toptal.com/designers/ui/design-facebook-10-inspirations-to-get-you-started">Facebook</a> was designed first for people at Harvard, not for a billion people around the world.</em> If Mark Zuckerberg designed Facebook for a billion people on day one, it would have failed. Facebook was online for two years before opening itself up to the general public.</li>
<li><em>Uber was originally a black car service in San Francisco.</em> Today, Uber has evolved from a local black car service, to a global ridesharing app, and now, to a service for lifestyle and logistics. In 2008, this wouldn’t have meant anything to anyone.</li>
<li><em>Flickr began as a photo-sharing feature within an online game.</em> Only after the product had been perfected did the team realize that it could be applied more broadly. In 2005, Flickr was acquired by Yahoo. Today, it has 51 million registered users worldwide.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>“Ego is the enemy of what you want and of what you have: Of mastering a craft. Of real creative insight. Of working well with others. Of building loyalty and support. Of longevity. Of repeating and retaining your success. It repulses advantages and opportunities. It’s a magnet for enemies and errors. It is Scylla and Charybdis.”</em></p>
<p>― Ryan Holiday, Ego Is the Enemy</p>
<h2 id="get-out-of-your-head">Get Out of Your Head!</h2>
<p>Designers all have a tendency to turn their life into a story. We write a fantastic narrative of our past with ourselves at the center – I helped design billion dollar companies or I worked for [insert massive startup here] – and this distracts us from designing for reality.</p>
<p>We often produce concept work to develop or show off our abilities as designers.</p>
<p>What I’m suggesting is to not let your ego guide you toward producing a concept for another billion-dollar startup. These companies became the way they are over long periods of refinement and being patient. Therefore we can only possibly provide an undeveloped opinion on redesigning their product.</p>
<p>The only reason that we might strive to design for the best brands is to fulfill our own career narratives.</p>
<p>As designers, we need to get out of our head and look instead to immediate local problems that call for unique <a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/design-services/"><strong>design solutions</strong></a>. Not only will this direct our abilities toward solving real problems, but it will also make us better designers while we’re at it.</p>
<p>There are often many lessons and opportunities surrounding us. However, if we’re caught up in the grandiose vision of our careers, these lessons will appear small or inconsequential, and we may miss them.</p>
<p>If you think that taking on a small project is demeaning to the potential scale of your work, get out of your head. Keep in mind that there is no one to perform for. And quite frankly, much less people are keeping tabs on your career than you may think. In fact, it’s likely that no one is. This can be hard to digest when you’re stuck inside your own head.</p>
<h2 id="dont-linger-on-past-successes">Don’t Linger on Past Successes</h2>
<p>When we reminisce about our past successes, we forget about the hours of work and execution that got us to where we are today. So instead of dreaming about your story, get back to work and out of your head. Start a new page daily, and eliminate any ideas of grandeur.</p>
<p><em>“I was trapped so terribly inside my own head that I was a prisoner to my own thoughts.”</em> &#8211; Ryan Holliday</p>
<h2 id="be-a-student">Be a Student</h2>
<p>In order for your design work to grow, you must be able to learn from criticism. Participating in the dialogue of design communities, such as Dribbble, is valuable, but they can also shelter your work from the lessons of reality.</p>
<p>The online design community is extremely supportive to one another. It’s great that everyone can so easily join such a conversation. However, constantly looking for positive feedback will not drive us to learn, so we must be careful in how eagerly we participate.</p>
<p>When you design for reality, clients and the public will be very hard on your work.</p>
<p>Although it can be difficult to hear negative feedback, we must see this as an opportunity to learn. The designer who works for their ego will be defensive during these times and will likely reject the opinion of the offender. We must learn to accept such criticisms if we want our work to grow.</p>
<p>The feedback loop between the designer and the client can make products that neither party could have ever made on their own.</p>
<p>As designers, we must realize that we can learn from the needs and conditions of a real project in order to make something new. Whereas, the feedback loop online often recycles the same content over and over again.</p>

<h2 id="thinking-small-and-local">Thinking Small and Local</h2>
<p>In reading this, you might be wondering <a href="https://www.toptal.com/designers/ui">where to start</a>. Designing for reality sounds great, but how do I get that first project? Or, if work is slow, what can I do to continue to grow?</p>
<p>This is very much my point – that often the answer to this is to whip up some great redesigns and post them online in the hope that they’ll lead to the next big thing. But, how can you direct your energy to design for real life instead?</p>
<p>Consider the challenge below.</p>
<h2 id="design-for-the-very-small">Design for The Very Small</h2>
<p>Instead of designing the next billion dollar chat app, what if you designed a chat app for five moms? What would that look like? Do you think something original would come out of it if you just focused on them?</p>
<ul>
<li>What would your social network look like if it was designed for the people in your building?</li>
<li>What would a payment service app look like for a farmer’s market?</li>
<li>How might a calendar registry app work for a day care?</li>
<li>Would a restaurant use a better interface for how they seat customers?</li>
<li>Could high school teachers benefit from an app to communicate with parents?</li>
<li>How might a to-do list work for a small family?</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s face it, it’s all about our ego. We design to get recognition instead of designing to solve a real problem for a small group of people.</p>
<p>I would argue that only designing for a successful Dribbble shot is thinking too small. It satisfies our ego, but won’t get us anywhere. Would you have taken Facebook as a client when they were only addressing Harvard?</p>
<h2 id="focus-your-design">Focus Your Design</h2>
<p>Gather five people in a niche and start designing a product just for them.</p>
<p>Don’t listen to your ego encouraging you to get likes and recognition. Focus on making the best possible product for those five people.</p>
<p>Here’s six points you should focus on.</p>
<ol>
<li>Involve real users in your designs as soon as possible.</li>
<li>Solicit feedback, and consider how your product can improve.</li>
<li>Don’t worry about scalability.</li>
<li>Kill aesthetics. Yes the aesthetic side of the design feeds our ego. The first focus should be getting a few users.</li>
<li>Avoid feature creep. Local problems can be complex too, but try to keep your solution simple.</li>
<li>Make sure your ego doesn’t creep up on you. Every time you start to really love something you worked on you should be wary. Your ego must be hiding behind your love.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="lets-work-to-kill-our-egos">Let’s Work to Kill Our Egos</h2>
<p>Whatever is next for us – failure or success – we must always continue to remember to avoid our egos.</p>
<p>No matter what awaits us down the road, our egos will make everything more difficult.</p>
<p>However, failure is the one thing that our egos will help to make permanent, unless we are willing to be students as we move forward, and learn from our mistakes.</p>
<p>We must take every moment as an opportunity to grow, not boost our careers.</p>
<p>Every great designer has experienced difficult times. You may just not realize it because all you see is their polished Dribbble accounts. What they likely aren’t telling you is that when they have failed – or found hardship – they take some kind of benefit from it.</p>
<p>Finally, keep in mind that many of the most successful people do not spread their work and successes around. So, look for people in your design community who are quiet about their success, or failure, and see what you can learn from them.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s fascinating to see that we’re surrounded by so many engagement and lead generation opportunities in today’s world, but the majority of businesses are still missing out a whole heap of revenue either by not having a website up and running or not improvising the best practices.</p>
<p>As marketing paradigms are changing, digital marketing is becoming relevant more than ever. It’s necessary to start off on the right foot when it comes to developing a website because the website does play a vital role in the <a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/5-out-of-the-box-digital-marketing-examples-from-2018/">digital marketing campaign</a> for any business.</p>
<p>The idea is to make your website engaging so that it intrigues visitors to explore, take action, and respond. To make that happen, we need to make the website communicate to the visitors in a way that it leads to engagement. The reason for emphasizing a lot on websites communication is that if it doesn’t stand out or attract visitors, then they’ll walk off the site. Not only does it require the website design to be subtle, but it also takes a solid website copy to get the job done.</p>
<p><em>Have you ever come across websites that have a difficult layout to navigate through?</em></p>
<p><em>Did you visit some websites that don’t clarify what they’re about?</em></p>
<p>Perhaps, we often stumble upon such websites that miss out lots of opportunities just because they don’t communicate well with the visitors.</p>
<p>In this blog post, we’re going to take a closer look at the elements that make websites communicates well and help businesses start the process of lead generation through websites. Here are some of the best strategies to achieve those goals:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>1 &#8211; Attractive Design and Layout</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-17212" src="https://static1.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Attractive-Design-1024x360.jpg" alt="Attractive Design" width="1024" height="360" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Attractive-Design-1024x360.jpg 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Attractive-Design-300x105.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Attractive-Design-768x270.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Attractive-Design-700x246.jpg 700w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Attractive-Design.jpg 1266w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Whenever a visitor lands on a website, the website design plays the role of a pivotal point. If the website design seems attractive and innovative, the visitor might stay longer unless the website isn’t slow. The science behind this is that the creativity in the web design might keep the visitor engaged for a little while. It doesn’t mean that the website design will hold on the visitor for minutes. Instead, it’ll be a matter of a few seconds.</p>
<p>What an <a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/web-development-services/"><strong>attractive web design</strong></a> could do is lead the visitor into a communication funnel such as filling up a form, moving to contact page, or signing up for the newsletter. It does look very simple, but in reality, it is not that easy to make it happen. It’s true that the website design alone can’t make visitors convert into subscribers or leads unless the message doesn’t resonate with the audience. The design isn’t the only key to the engagement. You’ll find out more in the next points.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>2 &#8211; Writing a Perfect Copy</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-17213" src="https://static2.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Writing-a-Perfect-Copy-1024x360.jpg" alt="Writing a Perfect Copy" width="1024" height="360" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Writing-a-Perfect-Copy-1024x360.jpg 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Writing-a-Perfect-Copy-300x105.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Writing-a-Perfect-Copy-768x270.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Writing-a-Perfect-Copy-700x246.jpg 700w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Writing-a-Perfect-Copy.jpg 1266w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>The most important thing after the website design and layout is the website copy. Not only does it translate your vision into words, but it also helps you send the message across. A website copy isn’t the longest form of content, so it has to be precise and to the point. The key here is to write a clear, concise, and understandable message. The problem with some websites either they go with a generic style of copy or opt to put out technically written content. So it doesn’t help either way.</p>
<p>On the other side, if the copy is simple, actionable, and enticing, then it impacts differently. One of the important goals of getting a website developed and optimized in the <a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/anatomy-successful-digital-marketing-campaign/"><strong>digital marketing campaign is that it communicates with the prospects</strong></a> and if the copy hinders that communication for whatever reason, and then there is no point of having a website.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>3 &#8211; Optin Forms and Popups</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-17214" src="https://static2.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Optin-Forms-1024x360.jpg" alt="Optin Forms" width="1024" height="360" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Optin-Forms-1024x360.jpg 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Optin-Forms-300x105.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Optin-Forms-768x270.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Optin-Forms-700x246.jpg 700w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Optin-Forms.jpg 1266w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Optin forms and popups work as a funnel in the lead generation process. After <a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/design-services/">website design</a> and copy, the optin strategy is an essential thing to take care of in the online marketing process. When the visitors land on the website and consume the content, the chances are they’ll walk away. What an optin form or popup does is that it builds a connection with the visitor through adding them to the email list.</p>
<p>It doesn’t happen so quickly. The visitors won’t sign up to the email list if there is no proper funnel is created, let alone if the right message on the optin form is not there. The process of highlighting the importance of optin forms is that website communication isn’t just about the website design and copy; instead, optins play a crucial role in converting visitors into leads.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>4 &#8211; Adding Call-to-Action Buttons</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-17215" src="https://static3.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Call-to-Action-Buttons-1024x360.jpg" alt="Call-to-Action Buttons" width="1024" height="360" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Call-to-Action-Buttons-1024x360.jpg 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Call-to-Action-Buttons-300x105.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Call-to-Action-Buttons-768x270.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Call-to-Action-Buttons-700x246.jpg 700w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Call-to-Action-Buttons.jpg 1266w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Call-to-Action buttons are imperative to build an interactive environment for engagement. Sometimes a well-written copy engages the visitors and put them on the conveyor belt to contact you. Then you need the right call-to-actions at the right spot to make the communication possible. If a call-to-action (CTA) isn’t there for visitors to check out, then either they will instantaneously leave without taking action or they’ll end up frustrated and leave the site forever.</p>
<p>There is another side of the story – you just don’t have to put any CTA on your website. In fact, it does have to be a relevant CTA. There is a wide range of CTAs that different brands use according to their need. For example, get a quote, talk to us, live chat, free report are a few popular ones. Don’t hesitate to experiment with some new ones. The truth is that CTA ignites the process of lead generation and the digital marketing strategy is incomplete without tools like call-to-action.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>5 &#8211; Install Necessary Analytics</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-17216" src="https://static3.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Necessary-Analytics-1024x360.jpg" alt="Necessary Analytics" width="1024" height="360" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Necessary-Analytics-1024x360.jpg 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Necessary-Analytics-300x105.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Necessary-Analytics-768x270.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Necessary-Analytics-700x246.jpg 700w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Necessary-Analytics.jpg 1266w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Analytics will allow the website owner to understand how the website is performing on the web. Analytics refers to the various forms of website traffic analysis and tracking. Besides regular tracking, Heatmap is a new web technology that tracks what portion of the website most visitors are spending time on and clicking as well. So analytics will help guide the website owners not just to create relevant content, but also to optimize the website elements to increase the click-through rate. Therefore, it becomes easier to figure out what kind of content visitors are looking at and CTAs they are clicking through.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
