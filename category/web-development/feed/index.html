								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A study done by Moz in 2019 revealed that the majority of local businesses agree that Google is becoming the new “homepage” for businesses.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21966" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/9-1.jpg" alt="Moz Study on Importance of Google and Website for Local Businesses" width="577" height="424" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/9-1.jpg 577w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/9-1-300x220.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 577px) 100vw, 577px" />A point to notice here is that it’s the local businesses that cannot deny the need for a website. Now evaluate your need for a website if your company is a modern-day tech-savvy startup.</p>
<p>Let us share a stat with you as well;</p>
<p>It just takes <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01449290500330448">50 milliseconds</a> (equal to 0.05 seconds) for a user to form an opinion about our business by looking at your website.</p>
<p>Thus you should really assess your approach, your resources, and your taste, twice, when it comes to developing a website for your startup.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Why is a Website Vital for Every Startup?</strong></h2>
<p>Website is one of those basic elements every company should start with when it comes to digitally enhance its look in front of the right audience.</p>
<p>However, this point is often not expounded as it should be and it leads you to see content with headings like; <strong>“Website development is dead”</strong> leaving you in immense confusion.</p>
<p>Today we’ll look into the need and dynamics of a website, for a startup, from a marketer’s eye. This means only practical uses and core requirements of a website will be discussed which directly impacts your startup for real.</p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>By sharing anything regarding web development for startups in this article, we’re especially targeting modern-day tech startups however all of this information pretty much applies to traditional small businesses as well.</p>
<p><strong>1) You don’t own/control these platforms</strong></p>
<p>Once a wise man said; <em>“Freedom has no price!”</em></p>
<p>All the digital platforms where you just sign up build a profile and start getting traffic by being active operate on their own terms.</p>
<p>There’s always some risk (if not a lot) of getting banned/penalized with just one malpractice of yours (or not even that in some cases) and you wouldn’t be in control to do anything as a response other than emailing their team.</p>
<p><strong>2) Pay or you won’t get any reach on social</strong></p>
<p>According to a study done by Jay Baer in 2014, as Facebook’s organic reach went down their stock prices went up.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-21971" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/8-1.jpg" alt="Facebook organic reach decline" width="593" height="417" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/8-1.jpg 820w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/8-1-300x211.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/8-1-768x540.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/8-1-700x493.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 593px) 100vw, 593px" />Your own website, on the other hand, can work independently without any reach decline risks.</p>
<p><strong>3) Social profile won’t display your unique brand image</strong></p>
<p>It’s as basic as it sounds. A Facebook/Instagram page or any social account for your business isn’t portraying your brand’s unique image contextually.</p>
<p>A brand image is far more than just making a grid on Instagram or posting pictures that align with your logo colors.  It means to;</p>
<ul>
<li>Control your brand narrative in front of your audience</li>
<li>Send your audience away (to social pages for example) when you want to</li>
<li>Customize the design/theme to resonate with your brand position</li>
</ul>
<p>If you pay attention, all of these requirements can only be fulfilled by…you guessed it right, a website.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Evaluating the Plan for Your Startup Website</strong></h2>
<p>Planning any website’s architecture, design, layout or anything of that nature purely depends on the need of the organization.</p>
<p>An NGOs website design would be entirely different than a startup’s design. This is web design 101 stuff. The question is how do you evaluate your startup’s plan in terms of the website?</p>
<p>Here’s the answer;</p>
<h3><strong>1) Assess your startup, &amp; define goals</strong></h3>
<p>Start by looking at the core of your business. Simply answering the following questions will help you move one step closer;</p>
<ul>
<li>What is my startup all about?</li>
<li>What is the way I want people to perceive my startup’s brand?</li>
<li>What is that I am trying to accomplish with my startup?</li>
</ul>
<p>As an example of this, let’s consider; <strong>SpaceX </strong>and<strong> Adobe. </strong>Both are very different companies with very different brands and it clearly reflects in their website’s design.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-21952" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/7.jpg" alt="How branding affects website design" width="777" height="408" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/7.jpg 1266w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/7-300x157.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/7-768x403.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/7-1024x537.jpg 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/7-700x367.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px" />That’s how a brand’s image is identified and portrayed in your web design sturdily.</p>
<p>Note: This is a phase you can only get done with, through brainstorming and ideation.</p>
<h3><strong>2) Judge your targeted audience</strong></h3>
<p>Next is judging your targeted audience. Knowing the people you’re targeting can be helpful to think of the way your website needs to be structured/designed/developed since those are the folks you’d be solving problems for.</p>
<p>But how does a startup know what its target audience wants if not even the first version of your website has been put forward? Or if you don’t have a targeted audience in the first place</p>
<p>There are various tools you can use for those purposes. <strong>SparkToro</strong> is one of the best out of all those.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-21953" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/6.jpg" alt="Sparktoro Homepage: Audience Intelligence tool" width="788" height="453" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/6.jpg 1266w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/6-300x172.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/6-768x441.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/6-1024x588.jpg 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/6-345x198.jpg 345w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/6-700x402.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 788px) 100vw, 788px" />All you have to do is give some keywords that resonate with your audience and it’ll pull the kind of content (articles/podcasts/videos) your audience consumes.</p>
<p>It will help you evaluate what would be your brand’s ideal positioning as per your consumer&#8217;s choice of content to plan your website branding.</p>
<h3><strong>3) Study your competitor’s approach </strong></h3>
<p>Studying your competitors can give you key insights into how your brand and onwards your website’s design/structure should look from a marketing perspective (we’ll jump deeper into the structural analysis in a few minutes).</p>
<p>Keyword research is a great way to identify the problems your audience is searching for the solution for.</p>
<p>And of course, your website should be structured in a way that those problems are solved on the page in the first look or the users are directed towards the solution properly.</p>
<p>You can either do all this research part manually by looking at your competitor’s website and content.</p>
<p>Or you can use a tool like <a href="https://try.alexa.com/target-audience-analysis">Alexa Audience Interest</a> which does it all for you.</p>
<p><strong><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-21954" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/4.jpg" alt="alexa audience interest tool" width="803" height="505" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/4.jpg 1266w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/4-300x189.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/4-768x483.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/4-1024x645.jpg 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/4-700x441.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 803px) 100vw, 803px" /></strong></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Planning the Website Development for Your Startup</strong></h2>
<p>It’s the easiest to keep your website’s structure/architecture when you’re just starting out.</p>
<p>So it’s important that you get every technical aspect covered and not overwhelmed by elements that are not so crucial (right now) either.</p>
<h3><strong>4) Think of Design &amp; Structural Ideas                 </strong></h3>
<p>You’d need to develop landing pages targeting specific keywords and set of audiences for various services. These landing pages will serve two purposes;</p>
<ul>
<li>Specifies each of your services on each page</li>
<li>Helps you market each service via paid ads or SEO later.</li>
</ul>
<p>A practical (and much efficient) way of analyzing your competitor’s website architecture is using a tool like ScreamingFrog. Just putting in the domain of your competitor you assess their website’s structure in one look as it appears in a simple tree diagram;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-21955" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/5.jpg" alt="Screaming Frog Website Tree" width="797" height="750" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/5.jpg 1069w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/5-300x282.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/5-768x722.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/5-1024x963.jpg 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/5-700x658.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 797px) 100vw, 797px" />This would help you decide;</p>
<ul>
<li>How many pages you need</li>
<li>What should the hierarchy look like</li>
<li>What pages to prioritize over others etc.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>5) Define your specific requirements</strong></h3>
<p>You have to know your product in and out. That’ll help you know what exact elements you need in your website.</p>
<p>Think, and understand from a consumer’s perspective, what would be needed on the homepage, if you’re looking for the solution of a problem that your product/startup solves?</p>
<p>For example, think of <a href="https://www.canva.com/" class="broken_link">Canva</a>. The product brings you a variety of creative design templates and if you were looking for those, their homepage would have directed you to your solution (their designs builder) in <strong>just three steps</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-21956" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/3.jpg" alt="Canva Homepage three step navigation" width="790" height="473" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/3.jpg 1266w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/3-300x180.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/3-768x460.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/3-1024x613.jpg 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/3-700x419.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 790px) 100vw, 790px" />Canva</strong> realized that all its user needs on the homepage is;</p>
<ul>
<li>Simple navigation displayed prominently</li>
<li>A search bar for user to search any design template</li>
<li>A section where the user can pick the design they want</li>
</ul>
<p>Another example to understand the concept better is that if you own a consulting and advisory firm.</p>
<p>What you are offering is a consulting call/meeting to businesses so that should be the most prominent element on the homepage as a call to action (and of course some good copy above that).</p>
<p>Advanced Process Optimization, a business consulting firm, does a good job of a CTA (call-to-action) regarding this;</p>
<h3><strong><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-21957" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2.jpg" alt="Homepage CTA for a consulting firm" width="790" height="500" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2.jpg 1266w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2-300x190.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2-768x486.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2-1024x648.jpg 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2-700x443.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 790px) 100vw, 790px" />6) Document all the information/ideas together </strong></h3>
<p>Being a tech startup owner doesn’t require you to be so tech-savvy that you build wireframes or design UI/UX for your website however you have to keep all your requirements document.</p>
<p>It doesn’t have to be highly technical. Just put out a piece of paper or use digital tools available; write your requirements with the website and draw a rough design.</p>
<p>You have to put two things in line with this process;</p>
<ul>
<li>An in-depth sitemap of all pages</li>
<li>The flow of the pages</li>
<li>Key elements you need (on some crucial pages at least)</li>
</ul>
<p>Till now you must have a clear vision for yourself; what you want, how it should be done etc. Let’s now assess the cost.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Cost Estimation for a Startup’s Website Development </strong></h2>
<p><strong>Short answer: </strong></p>
<p>Cleveroad did a massive breakdown of how much does it cost to build a website and according to their analysis the average costs range anywhere from<strong> $8,750</strong> to <strong>$38,000</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Long Answer: </strong></p>
<p>The answer to this question is pretty much variable and depends on the skillset of the resource being hired, the phases of development a website goes through, and the type of website that</p>
<p>Let’s dive deeper into the elements</p>
<h3><strong>Website development cost (by types)</strong></h3>
<p>The type of website being developed also impacts the overall cost. I.e. is it just a landing page, an eCommerce website, or a business website.</p>
<p>However, if we look at what the range of hourly rates looks like for each, we can get a value.</p>

<p><strong>Note: </strong>None of these numbers are 100% certain. They can go up or down depending on your exact requirement and the resource you hire; freelance, in-house, or agency.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Choosing a Resource for Your Startup’s Website Development</strong></h2>
<p>The resources generally available for website development service are either of the following;</p>
<ul>
<li>Freelancers</li>
<li>In-House</li>
<li>Agencies</li>
</ul>
<p>Startups initiate at different levels of funding and thus possess different levels of resources. You can go with either a freelancer, hire an in-house resource, or go with a digital agency.</p>
<p>All these resources have various merits and demerits to hire for the website of your startup. Here’s a quick overview of each resource;</p>
<h2><strong><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21968" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/11-1.jpg" alt="Freelancer VS In-house VS Agency" width="1266" height="672" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/11-1.jpg 1266w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/11-1-300x159.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/11-1-768x408.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/11-1-1024x544.jpg 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/11-1-700x372.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1266px) 100vw, 1266px" />Final Takeaway </strong></h2>
<p>Finally, there comes an additional factor of <strong>personal preference</strong> that would impact your choice of resource, your budget, and your website requirements.</p>
<p>However, in an ideal scenario, agencies/consultants have seen to outperform building a complete in house team for specified roles.</p>
<p>As a <a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/">digital marketing agency</a> ourselves it may seem like our approach is biased in this article however many marketing leaders, like Rand Fishkin (Founder of <a href="https://moz.com/">Moz</a> &amp; <a href="https://sparktoro.com/">SparkToro</a>), have in fact come to realize that going with agencies/consultants is a better option for almost every scenario.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Website development and design practices have gone through a lot of changes in the way we see them today. Nowadays, developing a website is also a matter of being creative and trendy than just having the technical knowledge.</p>



<p>According to Netcraft’s web server survey in January 2019, there are over 1 billion websites on the World Wide Web. And this whopping number of websites is increasing every second.</p>



<p>This literally means that there is 1 website for every 7 people on the planet. And that’s already a lot of websites.</p>



<p>For this reason, there is growing need for applying different tactics and techniques so that your website can stand out among so many others. Today, businesses and individual website owners have to go a step further in making their websites more advanced and personalized to the audience they are trying to attract.</p>



<p>So talking about the upcoming future trends in web design and development industry in 2020, web developers are required to keep up with a myriad of technological as well as design related trends.</p>



<h1><strong>Progressive Web Apps</strong></h1>



<p>Progressive Web Applications or PWAs are increasingly becoming popular among web developers and users.</p>



<p>A Progressive Web App or PWA is an application software. Or you can simply put that a PWA is a website that gives the look and feel of a native mobile app.Popular examples of progressive web apps are: Uber, Pinterest, MakeMyTrip, Twitter Lite and others.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img class="wp-image-19892" src="https://static1.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/uber.jpg" alt="" width="565" height="376" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/uber.jpg 700w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/uber-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 565px) 100vw, 565px" />

</div>



<p style="text-align: center;"> </p>



<p>Plus, you don’t necessarily have to download a PWA in your mobile phone &#8211; while you enjoy the ease of programming of a website. In PWAs, you get to access all the information and modern capabilities as you do in a mobile app.</p>



<p>Moreover, the modern features of PWAs are supported by majority of the web browsers. Meaning that every business can start to launch a website that’s smooth, swift, and app-like in its feel.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img class="wp-image-19893" src="https://static.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/starbucks-1024x1024.jpg" alt="" width="446" height="446" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/starbucks-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/starbucks-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/starbucks-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/starbucks-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/starbucks-570x570.jpg 570w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/starbucks-500x500.jpg 500w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/starbucks-1000x1000.jpg 1000w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/starbucks-700x700.jpg 700w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/starbucks.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 446px) 100vw, 446px" />

<p style="text-align: center;"> </p>



<p>For these reasons, <a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/web-development-services/">PWA web development</a> is going to remain a popular choice in 2020 and beyond.</p>



<p>It’s important to state here that most of the well-known companies have experienced a significant growth in their user engagement. And increase in user engagement gave them high conversion rates upon using PWAs.</p>



<p>Take the example of <strong>Twitter Lite</strong> as a good case in point. Twitter had realized that they needed an app that worked on every device, and loaded quickly. As it had to engage a whopping 380 million audience at that time, Twitter introduced its PWA version in the form of Twitter Lite.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img class="wp-image-19930" src="https://static2.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/twitter-mobile.jpg" alt="Twitter mobile" width="566" height="377" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/twitter-mobile.jpg 623w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/twitter-mobile-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 566px) 100vw, 566px" />

</figure>
</div>



<p style="text-align: center;"> </p>



<p>The results achieved were incredible! Twitter experienced:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>★ 65% increase in pages per session</p>
<p>★ 75% increase in Tweets sent</p>
<p>★ And a 20% decrease in bounce rates</p>
</blockquote>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<h3> </h3>



<h3><strong>Benefits</strong></h3>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>➝ <strong>App-like experience:</strong> Makes easy for your users to access your content &#8211; so they keep coming back.</p>
<p>➝ <strong>Faster loading time:</strong> Decreases the bounce rate (users clicking away from website after viewing only one page).</p>
<p>➝ <strong>Better UX:</strong> Engages users, which allows them to stay on your website for long.</p>
<p>➝ <strong>Lesser consumption:</strong> Internet data is consumed less.</p>
<p>➝ <strong>Increased Sales:</strong> Happy and engaged users increase conversion rates.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>UX Design</strong></h3>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Talking about a <a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/design-services/">UX design website</a>, there is cut-throat competition among websites in the online world. User experience or UX refers to the overall experience of a user looking at your website in terms of how easy and pleasing it is to use.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-19895" src="https://static3.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ux-design.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ux-design.jpg 600w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ux-design-300x150.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" />

</div>



<p style="text-align: center;"> </p>



<p>But why are UX design best practices becoming so much of a grave concern for almost every website owner?</p>



<p>It’s because users these days are super impatient in their online behaviour. A user today, according to <a href="https://allisonjedwards.com/the-attention-span-crisis-and-what-it-means-for-kids/" rel="nofollow">research</a>, can focus on a web page for just 8 seconds. This raises the chance of more users clicking away if you are not optimizing your UX design.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img class="wp-image-19896" src="https://static2.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/human.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="469" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/human.jpg 712w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/human-300x281.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/human-700x657.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></figure>
</div>



<p>So the more your website page visuals and style click the minds of the users, the more they enjoy checking it out.</p>



<p>A lot more focus will be on making the UX design more relevant to the taste of target audience in 2020. So that it reduces friction, and saves time of users.</p>



<p>Some important UX design best practices you should consider include:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>★ Personalize website according to your target audience.</p>
<p>★ Light popups suggesting tips to users to speed up their action taking.</p>
<p>★ Features should be visible only when a user needs to see them in a specific context.</p>
<p>★ Simple changes like placement of navigation bar, non-irritating presentation of adverts, and avoidance of distracting popups can work wonders.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Benefits</strong></h3>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>➝ <strong>Increase in Revenue:</strong>  75% of people think of a website based on its overall aesthetics. Organically increasing the engagement of users through awesome UX design is a good way of ensuring long-term increase in sales. Rather than depending on just advertising for boosting short term sales.</p>
<p>➝ <strong>Low Costs:</strong> Applying UX design approach in website development cuts a lot of costs.</p>
<p>➝ <strong>UX Design Increases Customer Loyalty:</strong> Positively engaging experiences bind users to your product. This keeps them coming back for more.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Chatbots</strong></h2>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Chatbots are empowered through Artificial Intelligence (AI). They simply help users to share their queries which they otherwise would enquire from a human customer service representative.</p>



<p>While the owner is away taking care of other things, AI helps bots solve problems and interact in a human like style with customers.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img class="wp-image-19898" src="https://static2.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/chatbox.png" alt="" width="463" height="400" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/chatbox.png 832w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/chatbox-300x260.png 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/chatbox-768x665.png 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/chatbox-700x606.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 463px) 100vw, 463px" /></figure>
</div>



<p>Due to its popularity and acceptance among internet users, more and more companies are opting for interactive chatbots on their websites. This demand for AI powered technology performing multitasking will see a rapid increase throughout 2020.</p>



<p>Furthermore, big companies are making financial investments to enable AI bots with complex thinking and negotiation capacity like that of humans. These AI chatbots now seem to take over the messaging industry with their multipurpose role capabilities.</p>

<p>“Google analysts also believe that next year, 2020, robots will be smart enough so that mimic complex behavior of humans like flirting and jokes”</p>

<h3><strong>Benefits</strong></h3>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>➝ <strong>Accessible anytime: </strong>People spend around 7 minutes until they are assigned to a CSR. Chatbots are replacing slower communication methods like emails, phone calls and live chat.</p>
<p>➝ <strong>Handling capacity:</strong> can communicate with thousands of humans at the same time.</p>
<p>➝ <strong>Satisfied Customers:</strong> Chatbots are not prone to emotions like human beings. They follow only what they are programmed to do. Bots also retain the user’s order history like address, name, number and other preferences &#8211; making transactions very simple and fast.</p>
<p>➝ <strong>Cost effectivity:</strong> You don’t have to pay a salary to a chatbot.</p>
<p>➝ <strong>Customer Data Recording:</strong> Bots are able to record consumer behaviour and their purchasing patterns. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ajagrawal/2016/07/13/7-ways-chatbot-tools-are-important-for-marketing/#3c4b4230602e">Forbes</a> says that this capacity helps any company to decide “which products to market differently, which to market more and which to redevelop for relaunch”. In this way, more personalized services to the consumer are achieved.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Minimalist Approach to Web Design</strong></h3>



<p>Another growing trend in web development is the need to prefer simplicity over visual splendour.</p>



<p>Neatly designed websites tend to gather more user appeal. So the practice of complimenting high quality visuals with minimalism and clean-design solutions is a great way of growing user appeal. It’s better if you hire a professional <a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/web-development-services/">web design and development company</a> that fully caters to all your business’s requisite needs.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img class="wp-image-19900" src="https://static.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/nerds-1024x497.jpg" alt="" width="549" height="266" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/nerds-1024x497.jpg 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/nerds-300x146.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/nerds-768x373.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/nerds-700x340.jpg 700w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/nerds.jpg 1347w" sizes="(max-width: 549px) 100vw, 549px" />

</div>



<p>Further focus is on writing personalized and simple worded content that engages users into exploring more about your brand.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img class="wp-image-19914" src="https://static3.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/the-law-practice.png" alt="new law practice" width="616" height="276" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/the-law-practice.png 697w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/the-law-practice-300x135.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 616px) 100vw, 616px" /></figure>
</div>



<p>This practice was started by the Microsoft Corporation in its OS development preferences. Where Microsoft began creating easy to navigate UIs (user interface) and proper placement of touchscreen ready elements.</p>



<h3><strong>Benefits</strong></h3>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>➝ <strong>Ranking &amp; Traffic:</strong> Google and other search engines rank your website to a higher position. And with better ranking and a neat website, you will get more and more traffic and leads.</p>
<p>➝ <strong>Loading Span: </strong>Web page loading speed is accelerated.</p>

<p>➝ <strong>User engagement:</strong> Better accessibility will let more users to be engaged on your website. Web</p>
</blockquote>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Single Page Applications</strong></h3>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p>A Single Page Application is a website that fits on a single page. The main goal of sticking to a single page style is to make the user experience effortlessly smooth.</p>



<p>Having said that, the old way of surfing a website’s pages is slow. It’s that whenever you want to go to a certain web page on the browser, each page takes time to separately load and then shows up.</p>



<p>Conversely, what SPAs do is that they instantly download all the web pages at the backend in the form of a file. In this way, SPAs save you from reloading any pages. As a result, scrolling through many pages becomes a matter of seconds for users.</p>



<p>The inconvenience of long page loading time is now being replaced by a growing trend in the development of SPAs in web development.</p>



<p>Because they are fast and easy to navigate, more companies are joining the race to create better SPA style websites for their users.</p>



<p>And so the SPAs here to stay in 2020 and beyond.</p>



<p>Remarkable examples of popular SPAs include:</p>

<p>And others.</p>

<h3><strong>Benefits</strong></h3>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>➝ <strong>Fast &amp; Swift:</strong> No need to reload pages again and again.</p>
<p>➝ <strong>User Friendly Readability:</strong> SPAs have designs that visually appeal to the sight. More appeal means increased conversion rates. When you better engage users, they always return to your website and are likely to purchase a product/service.</p>
<p>➝ <strong>Cost Effective:</strong> They are relatively cheap to develop and easy to set.</p>
<p>➝ <strong>High Performance:</strong> The overall performance is always better as less bandwidth is required by SPAs.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>AI Content Curation</strong></h3>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p>The true merit of a website is measured by its content. This fact cannot be emphasized enough.</p>



<p>Content is simply “the king” in user engagement.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img class="wp-image-19905" src="https://static.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/triberr-1024x575.jpg" alt="" width="563" height="315" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/triberr-1024x575.jpg 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/triberr-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/triberr-700x393.jpg 700w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/triberr-539x303.jpg 539w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/triberr.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 563px) 100vw, 563px" />

<p style="text-align: center;"> </p>



<p>Artificial Intelligence based content curation rules the roost in the upcoming future. AI algorithms will soon take over the process of content curation just as AI chatbots look after human queries.</p>



<p>So how will this happen?</p>



<p>An example can that be of a professional painter. While surfing the web, a painter won’t necessarily be interested in a lifestyle blog or an SEO blog, right? In such situations, AI will automatically be triggered to place painting related content on the forefront.</p>



<p>Websites will thus be developed and optimized in such a way in 2020 and beyond for more intelligent responses.</p>



<p>Moreover, users can also opt-out of these settings to have a more hands-on approach for filtering their content.</p>



<h3><strong>Benefits</strong></h3>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>➝ Automatic content selection and generation meaning better matched content for user.</p>
<p>➝ Easier time for users in finding relevant content..</p>
<p>➝ Personalized content for chatbots.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Motion UI</strong></h3>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p>If they say a picture is worth a thousand words. Then how would it be like if a picture moved and transitioned too? Motion UI technology allows you to do just that!</p>



<p>In simple words, a motion UI is a combination of transitioning pieces of animation to make things appear on a website as if they are moving. Developers are now focusing on motion UI for developing websites to make them look more appealing to the users.</p>



<p>Motion UI will soon be a high in demand web development trend because of its:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>★ High potential of usability</p>
<p>★ Modern animations</p>
<p>★ Dynamic visual graphics</p>
<p>★ The storytelling style of presentation</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It allows developers to use a wide range of tools and techniques. So that they can better engage target audience’s attention. Research claims that the average time span of human attention is even less than that of a goldfish.</p>



<p>That being said, today’s users have gotten super bored with hundreds and thousands of similar looking websites on the internet. Old static designs don’t visually appeal to their senses as much as they did in the year 2000 since attention spans are suffering.</p>



<p>That is where motion web UI comes into play. Motion UI’s captivating visuals are an awesome way of getting users to not get bored and pay attention.</p>



<p>Now if you’re successful in getting the user’s attention through motion UI, you can further engage them with your content. So you can turn these engaged users into qualified quality leads for your business.</p>



<h3><strong>Benefits</strong></h3>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>➝ <strong>Low Cost:</strong> It’s created by relatively small sized teams and its development is not costly.</p>
<p>➝ <strong>Always Fresh:</strong> Your site will never look old as designs get easily updated.</p>
<p>➝ <strong>Memorable:</strong> Beautifully captivating click the minds of your target audience so much that they tend to remember your website when they leave.</p>
<p>➝ <strong>More Leads:</strong> Memorable and engaging websites make users to make a purchase decision today or tomorrow as they remember your website.</p>
<p>➝ <strong>Lively Impression:</strong> A huge variety of innovative tactics can be applied that engage you more users.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Internet Of Things</strong></h3>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p>The term IoT or Internet of Things refers to all the electronic devices as a whole that can connect to the internet. Meaning any device that is connectable to the internet will fall in the IoT category.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img class="wp-image-19906" src="https://static.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/vpn.jpg" alt="" width="504" height="304" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/vpn.jpg 860w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/vpn-300x181.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/vpn-768x464.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/vpn-700x423.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 504px) 100vw, 504px" />

<p style="text-align: center;"> </p>



<p>IoT has applications in health care, smart cities, agriculture, wearable’s, smart home appliances with many other possibilities.</p>



<p>Now you must be wondering what IoT has to do with website development? Let me explain:</p>



<p>A lot of Internet of Things devices can display website content on them. Popular examples include smart appliances, UI on TVs, laptops, industrial monitors, smart speakers, smart phones, smart watches and glasses, and so forth.</p>



<p>Moreover, the devices in IoT are connected to one another via the internet, and work with huge amounts of data. IoT web development is therefore different from ordinary web development as it puts more focus on system’s scalability and reliability.</p>



<p>More and more new and diverse devices with web display capability are being developed. Therefore IoT will undeniably be an essential part of web development in 2020 and beyond.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Front end languages are a programming language used by developers on the front end of a site. This ‘front end’ is the external end of the site seen by the visitor. With different languages used front end, the web developer&#8217;s role would be able to create a theme in line with a set style of the site. These languages are installed so that the site can show the required material as intended to passing visitors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How do front end and back languages differ? While </span><a href="https://learn.onemonth.com/frontend-vs-backend-developers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">front end languages are used to program the front end of the site</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, back end languages are used to program and create the backend of the site.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to developing and creating the front end of your website or software, here are some of the recommended best front end development languages for you to choose from and their benefits. </span></p>
<h3><strong>1- JavaScript</strong></h3>
<div class="vc_empty_space"  style="height: 22px" ><span
			class="vc_empty_space_inner">
			<span class="empty_space_image"  ></span>
		</span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps one of the most important and popular of front end development languages, and that is JavaScript. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to front end development, it is near impossible to work on a site that does not run without using JavaScript. One of the most popular languages, the benefits of this software is due to its ability to create dynamic and responsive web pages. Not only are interactive web pages fantastic for user experience, but this useful addition can also play dividends when it comes to paid advertising.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With sites all around the world running JavaScript, from YouTube to Facebook you can find evidence of JavaScript without having to look too far. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are a beginner about to take their first steps in front end development, we recommend using JavaScript. This is thanks to its forgiving and flexible nature.</span></p>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speed</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simplicity</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Extended Functionality </span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Browser Support</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lack of Facility for Debugging</span></li>

<div class="vc_empty_space"  style="height: 22px" ><span
			class="vc_empty_space_inner">
			<span class="empty_space_image"  ></span>
		</span></div>
<h3><strong>2- CSS</strong></h3>
<div class="vc_empty_space"  style="height: 22px" ><span
			class="vc_empty_space_inner">
			<span class="empty_space_image"  ></span>
		</span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another popular programming language and staple addition to the front development of your website is CSS. Short for Cascading Style Sheets, when programmed into the running of your site, CSS can describe how the HTML elements on the site are displayed and presented onto the screen. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Controlling and presenting the page as intended by the developer the inclusion of CSS can save and reduce the amount of work. This can be done by controlling the layout of multiple web pages all at one time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Super simple not just to add, but also to code, without this addition you will be unable to personalize and style web pages. CSS can alter the appearance of colors, spacing, and fonts to the appearance of a web page. Embed images and video, as well as other media, and the addition of headlines and paragraphs. Without CSS the aesthetic choices on hand to personalize your website would be limited. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To implement CSS to the front end of your site, you are fortunate and require little more than a text editor. With many different sites available and programs to help you write this language, finding software for you should be a piece of cake. </span></p>

<h3><strong>3- HTML</strong></h3>
<div class="vc_empty_space"  style="height: 22px" ><span
			class="vc_empty_space_inner">
			<span class="empty_space_image"  ></span>
		</span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A standard feature at the front end of a website, when it comes to the best front end development language, you should look no further than the inclusion of HTML. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">HTML is short for Hyper Text Markup Language and is a standard markup language added when creating web pages for your site. This language is the structure of the page and will consist of a series of different elements to show the intended structure of the page. Without this element with the structure, the browser would be unsure and unable to display the content correctly. An example of HTML would be &lt;H&gt;10 Best Front End Development Languages To Develop Your Website &lt;/H&gt;. This tells the browser that the text is the title and to present it as such. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A basic front end development language, HTML should be viewed as a building block when it comes to the creation of web pages. Along with the creation of content and layout of the page, HTML tags can also be used to add visuals onto a page for the benefit of the viewer. </span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Source:</strong> Xcode</p>
<p>It is an integrated development environment that includes a suite of software tools to develop apps for the numerous platforms of Apple such as Macs, Apple Watch, iPad or iPhone, etc. It lets you completely manage your development starting from app creation, testing, optimizing, or submission to play store. It basically works on Mac operating systems with specific requirements of 7.6 GB hard drive space and macOS 10.14.4 or later.</p>
<p>The latest version is Xcode 11 which offers lots of new characteristics, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Swift 5.1 package manager support</li>
<li>Latest iteration of Swift</li>
<li>Building iPad applications under macOS</li>
<li>Minimap-overview of source code file that allows quick navigation</li>
</ul>
<p>Xcode IDE is coordinated with Cocoa Frameworks and Cocoa Touch and provides an effective stage for creating applications. It includes an easy environment that takes into account a progressively consistent work process of development. It involves a built-in Assistant Editor that gives accommodating codes that help with completing work quicker.</p>
<p><strong>Interface</strong></p>
<p>The swiftUI provides an interactive preview keeping the layout and code synchronized. You can also update the color of the interface and it allows you to create custom symbols images.</p>
<p><strong>Project configuration </strong></p>
<p>You can add capabilities to your app for the configuration of the services like push notifications. Sharing or leveraging codes of other developers between projects is applicable. Mac catalyst permits you to develop a Mac version for your iPad application.</p>
<p><strong>Debugging </strong></p>
<p>Allows you to run the app on a device or simulator. By using a continuous improvement cycle, you can always test or improve your app’s performance. The other advantage is to detect errors using crash reports. There are sanitizer tools available that can help you in identifying undefined behaviors or runtime crashes.</p>
<p><strong>Performance</strong></p>
<p>You can use technologies to help you streamline the installation, measure the app size, and optimize the settings or assets of the app.</p>
<p><strong>Testing </strong></p>
<p>Using XCTest, you can diagnose UI issues, logic failures, and performance regressions. It also allows you to erase coupling between components so that reliability and test coverage is enhanced.</p>

<p>Firebase is a backend as a service (BaaS). It began as a YC11 startup and turned up into a cutting edge application development platform on Google Cloud Platform.</p>
<p>Firebase liberates developers to focus on creating great user experiences.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t have to oversee servers. You don&#8217;t have to compose APIs. Firebase is your API, datastore, and server. These are all composed so conventionally that you can change it to suit most needs.</p>
<p>When you do the connection between your application and Firebase, you&#8217;re not associating through regular HTTP. You&#8217;re interfacing through a WebSocket. These are a whole lot quicker than HTTP. You don&#8217;t need to make separate calls for WebSocket, since one socket connection is enough. The entirety of your data matches up amazingly through that single WebSocket faster. The storage of Firebase gives a basic method to save the files and incorporates an easier service of hosting for the entirety of your static files. It can serve them from a worldwide CDN with HTTP/2.</p>
<p>Some of these features are applicable to iOS but not to web.</p>
<ul>
<li>Remote config</li>
<li>Notifications</li>
<li>Dynamic links</li>
<li>Crash</li>
<li>Test lab</li>
<li>AdMob</li>
</ul>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Progressive and React native apps are two different types of web applications with the variation of technologies.</p>
<p>The chance of these technologies to emerge was only due to the invention of “XML” and “HTTP” requests that gave a rostrum to retrieve data from “URL” without refreshing the page.</p>
<p>Both types of apps have been in use for a long time now, however, react-native have comparatively been getting extra popular over some years.</p>
<p>Let’s look at what the Google Trends data suggests about this;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-21188 size-full" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/google-trend.png" alt="" width="765" height="429" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/google-trend.png 765w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/google-trend-300x168.png 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/google-trend-700x393.png 700w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/google-trend-539x303.png 539w" sizes="(max-width: 765px) 100vw, 765px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Source:</strong> Google Trends</p>
<p>Clearly React Native has attained exponential growth over the years while progressive web apps have maintained a steady usage rate.</p>
<p>The same trend can be noticed in the demand of each one&#8217;s development service. <a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/react-native-app-development-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">React native apps development services</a> are increasingly more in demand with the passage of time as compared to <a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/progressive-web-app-development-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Progressive web apps development services</a>.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>That’s exactly what you’re going to find out later in this article.</p>

<p><strong>PWA (Progressive Web Application) is one of the types of software application which is delivered through a web platform. </strong></p>
<p>There is no specific file that needs to be installed and, therefore, it doesn’t need any platforms like “play store” or “iOS store” to install these applications. The development of these applications is based on common web technologies that include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
<p>As soon as PWA emerged in the market back in 2015, many big brands adopted this technology and it enhanced their business in various manners. Here’s a look at what PWA did for Twitter, Nikkei, and Hulu.</p>

<p>“React Native is a JavaScript-based framework used in writing real, natively rendering applications for mobile and for both iOS and Android.”</p>
<p>React is the building block of JavaScript. Its main focus is on mobile platforms, or to be precise web developers have access now to write mobile applications that give a complete look and a truly native feeling.</p>
<p>React native is known to be able to bring portability and efficiency of the web into a smartphone. World’s leading tech and digital companies have adopted react native for their web applications to run smoothly.</p>

<h2><strong>Progressive Web Apps VS React Native: What&#8217;s the difference?</strong></h2>

<p>In a magical world, if cost and time aren’t a problem, you should build both a PWA and a React Native solution and architect your app in a way so that it can be used as much logically between the PWA, React Native-Android, and React Native-iOS projects as possible. The PWA enables you the widest reach where any device with a browser can open that app. The React Native app provides an individual with depth where you get to take advantage of a device’s native UI controls for best performance and familiarity for users.</p>
<p>If you’re destined to target mobile devices (Android and iOS) only through the app store or play store, then opt React Native. If your target is to reach the widest range of users and devices then simply opt for PWA.</p>
<p>An application is written once using HTML, CSS, and JS will run easily on every platform where a browser is available. If a browser isn&#8217;t available, consider smartwatch or bands and so on, then an individual can always go with developing a hybrid app using a WebView that capsules your PWA and gets it on those tiny little screens. To make your PWA work well across all of these devices, you do need to ensure your app is responsive and adaptive and relies on progressive enhancement. Knowing the range of devices, you&#8217;ll need to support upfront is important.</p>
<p>If the best UI responsiveness and performance are the priority the react-native should be preferred. Native uses the iOS and Android native UI controls, so you get to use the platform that controls users who are familiar with along with the snappy performance of a non-HTML UI layer. With a PWA, the interactions are always going to be a bit clunky, the animations will be less rich, multi-touch will be less responsive, and the lack of multithreading will always retain your interactions fighting for priority with different things your app is doing.</p>
<p>Considering low-end devices gives individual ease to choose PWA since it is slightly better than React Native. Though it has been found that the UI layer in the React Native Application is composed of platform controls but the fundamental data communication is centered across JS. If you have an app that deals extensively with data, the slow JS throughput on lower-end Android devices is a very noticeable bottleneck that often makes the UI feel old fashioned.</p>
<p>React Native creates a native app package (usually tens of megabytes in size) that needs to be installed before the user seeing even a single pixel from your app. PWAs load in the browser immediately. This may be less of a problem in areas where you have plenty of cheap/fast bandwidth and device storage. If you are targeting large parts of the world where bandwidth and storage are problems, then a PWA is better. Installing an app from the app store is a major commitment, so giving users a lite version that is an instantly-available PWA and a richer version that is a React Native-based application that is installed through the app store is considered the best approach. We do realize this suggestion falls under the magical world where there are no time and resource constraints and you can build multiple versions of your app, but sometimes that is the best solution.</p>
<h2><strong>Which One Should You Choose?</strong></h2>
<div class="vc_empty_space"  style="height: 22px" ><span
			class="vc_empty_space_inner">
			<span class="empty_space_image"  ></span>
		</span></div>
<p><strong>What are you or your development team skilled in? </strong></p>
<p>There is always a nontrivial cost to learn new technology and train others on it. Both PWAs and React Native have their steep learning curves when you want to create a great user experience especially at the critical last-mile, so keep this detail in mind as a factor.</p>
<p><strong>Consumer or enterprise is being focused? </strong></p>
<p>Consumer apps require a higher degree of visual polish, and that makes it easier to go for React Native because you get to work with native UI controls. Enterprise apps should be visually awesome as well, but that is often not a differentiator since most enterprise apps can’t be substituted for something similar. A good PWA with (optionally) good offline capabilities could meet most enterprise requirements.</p>
<p>If the requirement is to have access to native device APIs then PWAs are limited by the browser sandbox, so you can’t go beyond what the Web APIs provide access to. If all you need is a webcam, camera, microphone, geolocation, etc., then you are good. If an individual needs core access to alter hardware or sensors, better Bluetooth support, and so on, React Native allows you to access the native hardware. You could take the hybrid app approach using Web View and fully extend your PWA with code for accessing native device capabilities, but that will require you to still develop a native app even if Apache Cordova or Ionic make that a breeze and go through the app stores.</p>
<p>If one or both are to be considered desktop and mobile? If a desktop is only consideration then react-native should not be preferred. Though there are desktop ports of React Native readily available, most aren’t maintained by the React team and have abundant gaps that an individual needs to address. A PWA will run well on desktops, but if you need more native access to lower-level APIs, the browser security sandbox will block you from getting that access unless you decide to rely on a WebView inside a native app (similar to Electron).</p>

<p>Jumping towards the conclusion, in order to opt for either PWA or native development, an individual should first define and analyze their goals and must narrow down what are must features required and any further functionality that individual wishes to offer to the user. If it isn’t demanding the end solution, then most probably it will be faster and cheaper to go with the development of progressive web application instead, rather than opting for the costly side that is the react-native. Similarly, if an individual prefers a faster app to access, he or she must go with PWA.</p>
<p>PWA is not capable of adding anything additional to existing applications in such a scenario you may consider the blend of both to be appropriate for an individual’s business goal and success as well.</p>
<p>The future era is PWA for mobile applications. There are positive chances that it might replace the native application over the course of time.</p>
<p>Let’s have a look at the popular applications that are built on PWA and React Native.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you had asked a website developer to build a website for your business some years back, it would have taken a lot of costs and precious time as well. But the present is different! It is no longer about just developing single static web pages with separate images, links, codes, and combining them together to build one specific website that meets your goals and requirements.</p>
<p>When Content Management System came into the vision, it changed all the functionalities and methods. <a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/cms-development-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CMS development services</a> divided the whole website into 3 levels of code, layout, and content.  Splitting the website into these stages makes it easier for you to develop a high-class website for your business to stand out the rest and grow sales.</p>
<h2><strong>What Makes a Good CMS?</strong></h2>

<p>First of all, you need to have a good knowledge of all the options that you have before rushing to a decision. It’s better to search for the key features in your CMS options rather than going for popularity.</p>
<p>Here are the 6 key features you need to look out in your content management systems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Easy to use content editor</li>
<li>Multiple user management</li>
<li>Marketing features</li>
<li>Plugins of 3<sup>rd</sup> party integrations</li>
<li>Mobile support</li>
<li>Design flexibility and core functionality</li>
</ul>

<p>WordPress was released in 2003 by Matt Mullen Wegg and powers more than 35% of the entire CMS based websites on the internet. It is an open-source content management system that is licensed under GPLv2 according to which anyone can modify or use it for free. WordPress is the most popular for <a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/ecommerce-website-development/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">eCommerce development</a> for online stores. Apart from this, it is extremely useful in the creation of business websites, resumes, portfolios, social networks, membership sites, and forums, etc.</p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the current onslaught of a huge chunk of internet users seeking fast, convenient and cost-effective services online &#8211; on-demand service is becoming more of a buzzword nowadays. The utility of on-demand service apps is simply undeniable because of the quality services they ensure.</p>
<p>Quality and shorter delivery time are in fact the main reasons why some of the on-demand apps have gathered immense popularity across the globe.</p>
<p>If you’re looking to launch an on-demand application service app &#8211; right now is a better time! In this blog, we’ll get to explore the types; recent trends; evolving opportunities; the business how to approach; and the growing importance of on-demand application builder community.</p>
<h2><strong>What On-Demand Service Apps are?</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It literally means a middle party software that acts as a source of connection between customers and service providers. On-demand services in simple words &#8211; facilitate communication &#8211; in audible, visual or textual forms &#8211; to get jobs done successfully.</p>
<p>Popular examples are Uber for taxis, Zomato for food, and Airbnb for hotels etc.</p>
<p>On-demand service platforms allow users to solve their daily problems. And in return, users are increasingly happy to pay for the services they get online. In this way, companies or on demand service providers grow their business reach and sales, and their customers find a convenient way of getting those services.</p>
<h3><strong>Why people use on demand delivery apps and what do they do on it:</strong></h3>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Reason for the popularity of these apps is the ‘instant problem solving value’ users get. So how do on-demand services actually turn inconveniences into solutions in just a few taps?</p>
<ul>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">“Oh no! I’ll be late, as it’s gonna take long for me to reach the bus stop. How about calling an Uber taxi to my current location &#8211; that’ll save me the time and effort”.</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">If I just order pizzas via Zomato app &#8211; I’ll be able to spend my full time with guests who have arrived already”.</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">“Now my inflexible job hours won’t hinder me from getting my father a regular medical check-up with Doctor on Demand app”.</li>
</ul>
<p>Above are just a few daily-life scenarios to quote.</p>
<p>Apart from getting the service, users also:</p>
<ul>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">Pay for services in the apps</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">Get real time notifications of service provider’s GPS location, time required, and audible, textual or even video communication and vice versa.</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">70% of the users use on-demand platforms to search for hiring services online, while 62% of them use on-demand apps to check the live status of the service they’ve ordered.</li>
</ul>
<h3></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Types and Nature of On-Demand Service Apps:</strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We can distinguish on-demand delivery apps into three forms depending on the nature of people involved:</p>
<ul>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">P2P (Person To Person): These on-demand service platforms allow individual users to exchange products with users.</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">Examples: Olx and eBay</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">B2B (Business To Business): These on-demand delivery apps are solely for supporting communication and service exchange between businesses.</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">Examples: Cargomatic and Catalant</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">B2P (Business To Person): B2P or B2C on-demand delivery apps facilitate services and products delivery from companies to customers. Meaning companies direct their employees to reach out and provide products and services to its customers and make money with it.</li>

<p><strong>Businessmen / App Service Providers:</strong></p>
<p>51% of on-demand app providers shared that their financial situation has improved as compared to the last year 2018 (Burson Marsteller Survey) &#8211; while 64% expect the same &#8211; for the next year 2020.</p>

<h3></h3>
<h3></h3>
<h3><strong>Do a Market Research</strong></h3>
<h3></h3>
<h3></h3>
<h3><strong><em>Competitors:</em></strong></h3>
