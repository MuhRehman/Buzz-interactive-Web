								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Software as a Service or SAAS is gaining momentum and popularity amongst businesses operating in a diverse range of industries, owing to its cloud features and relatively cheap cost.</p>
<p>While SAAS is popular amongst users, the software developers and marketers find it extremely difficult to design and market a SAAS software.</p>
<p>This is happening because of two reasons. One, software developers must think of innovative and unique ways of to introduce a feature(s) that give their product an edge over competitors.</p>
<p>In addition, they are faced with another dilemma; the feature that they introduce must be affordable and ideally should be less than the market price. The second issue pertains to marketers, who often find themselves in the dogfight of customers and advertisement platforms.</p>
<p>However, despite the enormous problems’ marketers face when advertising SAAS businesses, <a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/social-media-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">social media marketing</a> stays a popular choice.</p>
<p>If you wish to promote your SAAS business using social media platforms, read this guide and increase the scale and sales of your business.</p>
<p>This guide will be divided into four parts: before and after launch, increasing reach, and conclusion.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Before Launching Your SAAS Product </strong></h2>
<p>The pre-launch is an incredibly crucial time wherein marketers and engineers should sit down and gauge with each other. Marketers should understand the product as much as possible so that they devise a tactful and effective marketing strategy.</p>
<h3><strong>1. Define your audience</strong></h3>
<p>Conduct research online and off-line about prospective audiences and clients, for better results, talk to competitors’ customers and ask them about the issues they face when using their current SAAS software and try to remove the issues from your product.</p>
<p>For instance, before launching its vitalized platform, Netflix used Facebook and other platforms to gauge with the audience to ask questions about their video streaming experience and how much would they be willing to pay for a service that gave them access to millions of movies and television shows from across the world.</p>
<p>The surveys gave them the opportunity to collect emails and names of potential customers.</p>
<p>Much to their surprise, about 75% of the respondents responded in the affirmative, and when Netflix relaunched itself in 2013, it had gained over 30 million subscribers in one year.</p>
<h3><strong>2. Identify vital social media channels</strong></h3>
<p>While the old saying goes that you should not put all your eggs in one basket, it does not stand for social media.</p>
<p>Social media advertisement isn’t cheap, therefore, you’ll have to do your research and identify which social media platform well-suited to promote your SAAS business and you should advertise on it conveniently.</p>
<p>Netflix, for instance, used YouTube to promote itself since the latter is a video-streaming website and has over two billion users.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-21760 size-full" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1-1.jpg" alt="Netflix as a SAAS Product ran ads on Youtube " width="1365" height="872" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1-1.jpg 1365w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1-1-300x192.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1-1-768x491.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1-1-1024x654.jpg 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1-1-700x447.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1365px) 100vw, 1365px" /></p>
<p>This gave it the opportunity to showcase its content to a global audience and increase its reach.</p>
<h3><strong>3. Develop pre-launch interest</strong></h3>
<p>Create interest and curiosity among your targeted audience before formally launching your product by having an active social media presence, indulging in paid partnerships with social media influencers, and increasing your presence on topical websites, such as Quora, Reddit, and etc.</p>
<p>The key to a successful social media campaign is that you give very little information in the most creative ways; one way to do this by writing less and redirecting the post towards your website.</p>
<p>Also, here are a few pointers that you should keep in mind when developing a pre-launch interest:</p>
<ul>
<li>What problem does my SAAS product solve?</li>
<li>How valuable would this solution be to the user?</li>
<li>How do I be innovative in my consumer-approach</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s how a <a href="https://www.funnelcrm.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Funnel CRM</strong></a>, a famous CRM Software for businesses, created curiosity, with their abstract concepts on social media;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21761" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3-1.jpg" alt="Funnel CRM Posts on Instagram developing curiosity in consumers mind" width="1365" height="1164" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3-1.jpg 1365w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3-1-300x256.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3-1-768x655.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3-1-1024x873.jpg 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3-1-700x597.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1365px) 100vw, 1365px" />See how creatively Funnel CRM not only placed their product as a modern world solution to an old age problem but also made the creative catchy and attractive enough to grab your attention.</p>
<h3><strong>4. Create a community around your product</strong></h3>
<p>Create a group of hard-core community of diehard followers by either creating a Facebook page or group or an email list and advertise your product in this group.</p>
<p>Advertise your product in the community, but do NOT give away the product entirely. In this community, you could offer financial and non-financial incentives like a discount, lifetime access to the SAAS product at incredibly low costs, or give rewards for the first fifty sign-ups, etc.</p>
<p>Another way to gauge your community is by maintaining special records and lists of potential leads and early sign-ups and you should convert them into your die-hard followers.</p>
<p>You must bear in mind that the initial sign-ups are your biggest assets and they deserve to be treated in a special way.</p>
<p>Also, the first sign-ups can be an excellent group for alpha testing.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>After Launching the SAAS Product</strong></h2>
<p>Once the product is launched, your marketing strategies will change and will be more about increasing your product’s scale and reach.</p>
<h3><strong>1. Start Putting Out Content</strong></h3>
<p>Once your product has been launched, there are no secrets to keep or hide. But the job now is that you educate the audience about your product and its features. But, most importantly, you must convince them as to why they should switch to your product.</p>
<p>While doing so, you should put the focus on the following aspects of your product:</p>
<ul>
<li>Its features</li>
<li>What does it do?</li>
<li>What new feature(s) does your product offer?</li>
<li>Why should customers take the leap to your product?</li>
</ul>
<p>At this point, you should aggressively engage in social media posting and content promotion. The key is to educate the consumer about your product and elaborate on its features.</p>
<p>The more likely the audience will understand it the more they’ll be inquisitive about it</p>
<p>We already know how aggressively Ahrefs promote and do marketing of their SEO SAAS product on social media.</p>
<p>Let it be Youtube Videos, Blog Posts promotion on Facebook and LinkedIn, or random clicks showcasing their office’s culture, they’ve always done a fascinating job at engaging the user with their content.</p>
<p>However, this time let’s look at their pattern when they’ve just launched a new feature within their product; <strong>Ahrefs Webmaster Tool</strong>.</p>
<p>In short, it’s a free tool that allows you to dig insightful data to track and measure your website’s overall performance. But the interesting part is how they promoted this new feature across various social media platforms.</p>
<p>Ahrefs created a buzz anywhere they could with the announcement. Here all that we’ve been seeing on some of the famous social platforms since their new feature’s launch;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21767" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2-1.jpg" alt="Ahrefs Webmaster Tool Promotion on Social Media" width="1365" height="1292" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2-1.jpg 1365w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2-1-300x284.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2-1-768x727.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2-1-1024x969.jpg 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2-1-700x663.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1365px) 100vw, 1365px" /></p>
<ul>
<li>They created a full video tutorial &amp; posted on YouTube/Facebook/LinkedIn</li>
<li>They promoted their tool directly on LinkedIn/Facebook/Instagram</li>
</ul>
<p>That is how it’s to be done for your SAAS business as well; in a full invasive mode.</p>
<h3><strong>2. Test Various Forms of Content</strong></h3>
<p>With many people using different forms of social media, it is becoming increasingly difficult to pinpoint which channel will be most suited for your product.</p>
<p>Therefore, it&#8217;s best if you advertise your product in every medium. However, an effective way to engage the audience would be by diversifying your content advertising techniques.</p>
<p>You should not stick to one form of content, instead, you should be as experimental as possible.</p>
<p>Try incorporating images, infographics, data graphs, podcasts, videos, and audio clips to enhance the reachability of your content. This is important because people absorb and understand the content in different ways.</p>
<p>Therefore, to ensure that your business reaches a large audience, you must experiment with the various forms of content.</p>
<p>The following forms of content can be may help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Written posts (with/without images)</li>
<li>Link to External content</li>
<li>Short/Long Videos</li>
<li>Detailed Infographics</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>3. Partner with Social Media Influencers</strong></h3>
<p>The social media, especially Instagram, is filled with influencers, but a handful of them are techno-influencers.</p>
<p>Therefore, the biggest challenge for you when partnering with social media influencers would be to find trustworthy and reputable influencers who understand technology, its uses, your product, and are successfully able to help you sell your product.</p>
<p>However, there are some tips and tricks to find and partner with social media influencers.</p>
<ul>
<li>Search about relevant influencers in your industry using platforms such as Google, Quora, and Trendspotter and get in touch with them.</li>
<li>Search some hashtags relevant to your SAAS product’s nature on platforms like Instagram or Twitter. Then go check various posts that show up and analyze their accounts to see if they qualify as an influencer.</li>
<li>Look at the influencers promoting your competitor’s SAAS product. Even if you’re not interested in partnering with them, you may find a whole circle of influencers you can reach out to.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>4. Engage &amp; Be Responsive Towards Your Followers</strong></h3>
<p>When you have running and established communities around your SAAS product and have achieved a customer base, you must be responsive to them all the time.</p>
<p>Not only should you reply to comments, respond to messages and emails, but you should also post regularly, and maintain an active social media account. An active social media presence will gauge the audience and they will use it to reach out to you if they face any issues.</p>
<p>Also, your audience as well as certain social media platforms, such as Facebook, rate you on your response time; the lesser the response time, the higher the rating.</p>
<p>Jay Baer, the founder of Convince &amp; Convert, an online company that specializes in digital marketing reported that 42% of consumers expect a response within an hour, and 32% expect a response within half an hour.</p>
<p>Let’s take the example of <a href="https://slidebean.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Slidebean</strong></a>, a startup presentation, and pitch desk creating software.</p>
<p>Apart from producing great quality and highly informative videos relevant to their niche, they do something that’s amazing for a YouTube channel with <strong>174K subscribers</strong>. They reply to every single comment on their videos.</p>
<p>Not just that, sometimes they do reply being specific to the comment which makes it more valuable for the commenter.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21762" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/4-1.jpg" alt="SlideBean as a SAAS Product Replying to each consumer on social media" width="1365" height="1513" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/4-1.jpg 1365w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/4-1-271x300.jpg 271w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/4-1-768x851.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/4-1-924x1024.jpg 924w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/4-1-700x776.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1365px) 100vw, 1365px" />The sooner you respond, the better the customer perception, which is an integral trait to possess in the digital market, he emphasizes.</p>
<p>In addition, if a customer has been treated badly by your brand and posts a bad review online, the word will get out quickly, which can give bad meat to your competitors to chew.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is extremely crucial for your company to respond to customers’ feedback in a timely manner.</p>
<p>Once you have launched and established your product, now you must focus on increasing its reach.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Scaling the Reach for Your SAAS Product</strong></h2>
<p>You&#8217;ve put out a great product in the market, your business is moving towards stability each day, and is progressing towards sustainability. That&#8217;s exactly the time you scale your business and chase those herculean numbers.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how to do it.</p>
<h3><strong>1. Invest in Paid Advertising</strong></h3>
<p>The paid advertisement goes a long way, so use it as much as you can.</p>
<p>Social Media paid advertisement not only help you get clicks, but it increases the reachability of your business.</p>
<p>When you pay to advertise your content on social media, you are helped by the algorithms of these platforms. Facebook and Instagram, for instance, display your product to your targeted demographics.</p>
<p>For instance, Facebook alters its algorithms from time to time to scale out and provide relevant content to its users based on their searches. Consequently, the organic post reach for branded pages has decreased by 40%.</p>
<p>As per the statistics provided by AdWeek, the average branded Facebook post will only reach 2.6% of the brand’s targeted audience, which means that approximately 97% of the brand’s followers won’t see the brand’s posts.</p>
<p>And it’s not just limited to Facebook. Most of the social media platforms will limit or have limited the organic reach on their platform. Although some platforms still have exceptional potential, that may never unleash properly unless you invest in paid advertising for your SAAS business.</p>
<p>That’s exactly why a lot of big SAAS companies like Hubspot and Ahrefs still invest in paid ads for either their content or product’s direct promotion even though they already have big social media following.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21763" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/5.jpg" alt="Hubspot &amp; Ahrefs Investing in Paid Ads on Facebook" width="1365" height="1164" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/5.jpg 1365w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/5-300x256.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/5-768x655.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/5-1024x873.jpg 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/5-700x597.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1365px) 100vw, 1365px" />Here’s a list of platforms you can run ads on to target your customer for either brand awareness or conversions;</p>
<ul>
<li>Google Ads</li>
<li>LinkedIn Ads</li>
<li>Facebook Ads</li>
<li>Instagram Ads</li>
<li>Pinterest Ads</li>
<li>Twitter Ads</li>
</ul>
<p>When we talk about scaling through social media marketing, Facebook’s Pixel and Retargeting options can be massively helpful. In fact, we’ve recently delivered an <strong>800% Return-on-Investment</strong> and <strong>350% increase in revenue</strong> for a fitness clothing brand by deploying the same tactics.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/digital-marketing-for-clothing-brand-case-study/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>Case Study: Social Media Marketing for a Clothing Brand (350% More Revenue) </b></a></p>
<p>When done right, these tactics can bring significant results for SAAS companies too.</p>
<h3><strong>2. Promote Discount Offers Regularly</strong></h3>
<p>On your social media handles, give our discount offers and to gauge your community more, ascribe one day as a discount day.</p>
<p>Offer exclusive discounts on public holidays, like Thanksgiving, Christmas, and the New Year’s. To gauge more customers and identify potential users it bets if you offer a seven-day or a month-long free trial. Netflix has a free-trial option and about 47% of the users subscribed to one of the packages after their free trial ended.</p>
<p>Therefore, if the free trial marketing tool works for Netflix, you should try it too.</p>
<h3><strong>3. Invest in Viral Marketing</strong></h3>
<p>These days trends are mostly formed when things go viral and things go viral over social media all the time, whether it’s the Kiki Challenge or Baby shark, you too can have your SAAS product viral all over the internet.</p>
<p>Viral marketing relies solely on creativity. The concept must be as such that people are prompted to share it. The benefits of viral marketing are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>It increases your business reach.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If your business goes viral, it will reach EVERYWHERE. For viral marketing to work, people need access to the internet, which the majority of the people do across the globe. So, let’ say your viral campaign starts from Chicago, someone in New Zealand can see it and order it.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>It is extremely cheap.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You create the advertisement once and must wait for it to go viral, once its viral, you do not need to spend tons of money on it.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>It gives credibility to your business.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>When there is so much buzz about your business and everyone is talking (sharing) about it, people will assume that it&#8217;s genuine, which will give credibility to your business.</p>
<p>The question is how exactly a SAAS startup go for viral marketing? Creativity is the backbone of making something go viral. Let’s take the example of <strong><a href="https://www.hipchat.com/" class="broken_link">HipChat</a></strong> used to be software for one-on-one chatting, group chats, file storage, and video calling.</p>
<p>A few years back when they were just starting their marketing, they were short on budget and their CEO somehow got earned a cheap billboard ad at 101 North in the San Francisco Bay area for a few weeks. Knowing that he won’t get a chance of running a billboard ad this cheap ever again, he came up with an amazing idea that had the potential to go viral.</p>
<p>But why is a SAAS business investing in billboards in the first place? Well, it was an indirect way of promoting themselves on social media.</p>
<p>For the ad, HipChat’s CEO picked Rage comic’s Y-U-No guy and displayed a minimalistic advertisement only for a cost of 7K$.</p>
<p>The results?</p>
<p>Pictures of the billboard ad went extremely viral on platforms like Twitter &amp; Tumblr.</p>
<p>Their website search traffic increased by 300%</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21764" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/6.jpg" alt="Famous SAAS business, HipChat's Viral &quot;Y U No&quot; Meme Billboard ad " width="1365" height="1658" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/6.jpg 1365w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/6-247x300.jpg 247w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/6-768x933.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/6-843x1024.jpg 843w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/6-700x850.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1365px) 100vw, 1365px" /></p>
<p>You probably are thinking how a billboard ad can get someone enhancement in the website&#8217;s traffic?</p>
<p>Well, the whole story got featured in many famous publication giants, like <strong>TechCrunch</strong>, and it let to the whole internet searching about them. They made people search and find about them.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21766" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/7.jpg" alt="HipChat's Viral &quot;Y U No&quot; Meme Billboard Featured in TechCrunch" width="1365" height="1106" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/7.jpg 1365w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/7-300x243.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/7-768x622.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/7-1024x830.jpg 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/7-700x567.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1365px) 100vw, 1365px" />With just one smart move they created a remarkable level of buzz in the internet world.</p>
<h3><strong>4. Hire an Experienced Digital Agency</strong></h3>
<p>Digital agencies specialize in digital and <a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/social-media-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">social media marketing</a>. So, if your SAAS business is valuable to you, you must invest in a digital agency.</p>
<p>We understand that most people, especially start-ups find digital agencies extremely expensive, but in the long-run, they prove to be fruitful and your long-term return on investment (ROI) will be much higher than it would be without one.</p>
<p>Digital agencies know what they’re doing, and they are trained marketing professionals who know how, when and what to target to launch your SAAS business.</p>
<p>Now think of it this way, your idea will be mind-blowing, but of what use is it if doesn’t reap financial benefits for you, so to ensure the success of your business, you must hire a professional digital agency.</p>
<p>Before you hire a digital marketing agency, you should ask yourself the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>What are your company’s requirements?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You should ask yourself what you wish to have achieved from the marketing agency. Do you want to have a website designed or promote your product? Once you are clear about your aims, you can shortlist agencies that align with your objectives.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>How does the agency run its affairs?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If the agency can run its business effectively using the ‘right’ advertisement tools, it serves as the right sign for you to do business with them.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Has the agency worked with a SAAS business?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You will come across many digital marketing agencies, but very few of them have had SAAS businesses as their clients.</p>
<p>Therefore, when shortlisting a company, you must ensure that you choose a company that has worked with SAAS business in the past.</p>
<p>This will make things easier for you since their previous experience will help them devise an effective marketing strategy for your business and you won’t have to explain to them the nitty-gritty details of your requirements and expectations.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Instagram continues to be a driving force for influencers and brands everywhere, having a large and engaged following on Instagram is now more important than ever. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, gaining followers is no easy feat as Instagram’s ever-changing algorithm makes it a challenge to get engagement and keeps up with trends.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, as virtually every brand and business aims to become Insta-famous, it&#8217;s even harder to stand out on Instagram these days. While gaining new followers organically may seem overwhelming, it certainly isn’t impossible. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to give your Instagram a<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-19054" src="https://static.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Canva-1.jpg" alt="Canva" width="1" height="1" /> new lease on life, use the following five tools to gain more followers and better your Instagram marketing strategy:</span></p>
<p><img class="wp-image-19048 size-full aligncenter" src="https://static2.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Kicksta.png" alt="Kicksta" width="700" height="300" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Kicksta.png 700w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Kicksta-300x129.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<h2>1.Kicksta for Instagram Growth</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the best ways to grow your following on Instagram is to use a growth tool like Kicksta. Using Kicksta to </span><a href="https://kicksta.co/how-to-get-real-followers-for-instagram"><span style="font-weight: 400;">get more followers on Instagram</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will help you attract interested followers that will consistently engage with your posts. For many Kicksta clients, these followers are easily converted to customers and long-term clients. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clients love how easy it is to organically grow an authentic following with </span><a href="http://kicksta.co"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kicksta</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This service works by targeting the followers of accounts similar to yours and liking a few posts from each follower’s feed. Interested followers will visit your page and likely follow you back, resulting in a growing following of real and engaged Instagrammers.</span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-19054" src="https://static.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Canva-1.jpg" alt="Canva" width="1" height="1" /><img class="aligncenter wp-image-19054 size-full" src="https://static.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Canva-1.jpg" alt="Canva" width="790" height="350" /><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-19054" src="https://static.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Canva-1.jpg" alt="Canva" width="1" height="1" /></p>
<h2>2. Canva for Instagram Graphics</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to create quick and high-quality Instagram images, </span><a href="http://canva.com" class="broken_link"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Canva</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> should be your go-to tool. Canva is a secret weapon for many small businesses and brands that don’t have an in-house graphic designer. With Canva’s easy-to-use interface, anyone can create a creative and visually pleasing graphic. Even if you have no experience as a designer, you can use the pre-designed templates and have a ready-to-post graphic in seconds.</span><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-19054" src="https://static.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Canva-1.jpg" alt="Canva" width="1" height="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Canva, you can easily create stunning graphics that are perfect for your Instagram feed or your stories. Whether you choose to create a completely new image from scratch or use one of their many templates to help you get started, the creative options are truly limitless with Canva. The more you familiarize yourself with the app or web version of this powerful content creator, the more Canva will become an integral part of your Instagram campaigns.</span></p>
<p><img class="wp-image-19047 size-full aligncenter" src="https://static3.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/planoly.png" alt="planoly" width="943" height="341" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/planoly.png 943w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/planoly-300x108.png 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/planoly-768x278.png 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/planoly-700x253.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 943px) 100vw, 943px" /></p>
<h2>3. Planoly for Scheduling</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scheduling is made easy with </span><a href="https://www.planoly.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Planoly</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Ever wonder how well a new graphic will fit into your feed? Using Planoly, you can drag and drop your photos into your grid to see what looks best. This makes it easy to keep your content as consistent as possible when planning your feed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you select the images you plan to use, you can write the hashtags and description for your post inside the app. Once everything is added, your posts will be ready to go. Far more than a simple planner, Planoly makes it easy to run your Instagram from the app itself. Use Planoly to curate and repost other content, analyze your analytics, make drafts of grids, and manage your comments all from the app. Whether you’re planning your stories or your Instagram feed, Planoly is essential for scheduling your Instagram content.</span></p>
<p><img class="wp-image-19050 size-large aligncenter" src="https://static3.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/VSCO-1024x373.png" alt="VSCO" width="1024" height="373" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/VSCO-1024x373.png 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/VSCO-300x109.png 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/VSCO-768x280.png 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/VSCO-700x255.png 700w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/VSCO.png 1210w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<h2>4. VSCO for Editing Images</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With powerful, one-tap photo editing, </span><a href="https://vsco.co/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">VSCO</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is beloved among Instagrammers everywhere for its efficiency. With a multitude of beautiful filters, VSCO allows you to create curated content that is perfectly tailored to your brand’s aesthetic. As you get the hang of using VSCO, you’ll gravitate towards a few favorite filters that will work to visually tie all your images together. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VSCO is ideal for the Instagrammer that wants to edit on the go or a brand that needs to create a highly-curated and consistent feed. Instead of having to use an overly complicated editing process, when editing, simply open your photos in the VSCO library and select a photo. In the VSCO library, you are able to see all your potential posts, which essentially acts as a preview to your Instagram feed.</span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-19051 size-large" src="https://static1.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Iconsquare-1024x429.png" alt="Iconsquare" width="1024" height="429" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Iconsquare-1024x429.png 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Iconsquare-300x126.png 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Iconsquare-768x322.png 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Iconsquare-700x293.png 700w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Iconsquare.png 1028w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<h2>5. Iconosquare for Instagram Analytics</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Businesses, brands, and <a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/">social media marketing agencies</a> that use Instagram, have easy access to all the pertinent data about their content’s performance. While there is certainly a plethora of information available through these metrics, it can be a challenge to figure out how to use this information to improve your content. Put your metrics to work for you with </span><a href="https://pro.iconosquare.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iconosquare</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Iconosquare, you can view the analytics of how many followers like your content, what followers are commenting, and the percentage of potential followers that aren&#8217;t following you but like your content. Through Iconosquare, you gain access to daily and weekly reports, keeping you up to date on your engagement. This information is displayed in the form of scores: the love rate, tap rate, and the spread rate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, you can view your statistics in the form of a pie chart, a bar graph, and a line graph. With Iconosquare, you can also see what media receives the most comments and the best time for you to post your content. This makes it easier to plan your posts, as you know when to post and who is more likely to respond positively to your content. </span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Facebook is the third most visited website on the internet. According to the new numbers, the social platform has <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/264810/number-of-monthly-active-facebook-users-worldwide/?utm_source=BuzzInteractive.co&amp;utm_medium=BuzzBlog">2.23 billion monthly active users</a>.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-18529 size-full" src="https://static3.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/FB-Chart.jpg" alt="FB Chart" width="680" height="431" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/FB-Chart.jpg 680w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/FB-Chart-300x190.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>Facebook users are engaged and they love to consume content. This makes it one of the most reliable platforms to find qualified leads. But, when you are starting, it’s rather difficult to build a huge user base or quality audience right away. No matter how effective your <a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/social-media-services/">social media marketing</a> maybe or whatever <a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/content-recipe-ingredients-for-a-great-content/">content recipe</a> you use.</p>
<p>This leaves startups, growing businesses, and solopreneurs with a million dollar question: How exactly you can grow your Facebook following fast?</p>
<p>The easiest solution is to research your rivals and target their audience. Look at it this way; if your potential customers can be interested in a competing or similar service/product, why won’t your competitors’ users be interested in yours?</p>
<p>Here’s how you can target your competitor’s audience or even better see who are the people that are interacting with your rivals.</p>

<p><em>#AmReading “How to Target Your Competitor’s Facebook Audience.</em><br /><a href='https://twitter.com/share?text=%23AmReading+%E2%80%9CHow+to+Target+Your+Competitor%E2%80%99s+Facebook+Audience.&#038;via=buzz_interactve&#038;related=buzz_interactve&#038;url=https://www.buzzinteractive.co/how-to-steal-your-competitors-facebook-audience/' target='_blank'>Click To Tweet</a></p>
<hr />
<p>Yes, being a <a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/">social media marketing agency</a> we are shooting ourselves in the foot here but we are still going to show you how exactly you can do that using an awesome Chrome extension along with <a href="https://scrapebook.net/">ScrapeBook</a> and another tool.</p>
<p>Ready to roll?</p>
<p>Let’s hit it.</p>
<h2><strong>Step #1 Find your competitor’s best performing posts</strong></h2>
<p>To get started, analyze your competitor’s Facebook post and find their best performing content. Or simply use these strings to do so:</p>
<ul>
<li>https://www.facebook.com/search/str/<strong>[put_your_competitor_domain_here]</strong>/stories-keyword/intersect</li>
<li>https://www.facebook.com/search/str/<strong>[put_your_competitor_keyword_here]</strong>/stories-keyword/intersect</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Make sure to edit the string and then copy, paste it into the browser field. Repeat this process every time you need to run a new search.</p>
<p>I am using this <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/gerardcompteduran?utm_source=BuzzInteractive.co&amp;utm_medium=BuzzBlog">Gerard Compte</a></strong> post as an example here:</p>
<p>https://www.facebook.com/search/str/<strong>Gerard%20Compte</strong>/stories-keyword/intersect</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-18520 size-full" src="https://static3.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/gerard-1.jpg" alt="gerard" width="514" height="605" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/gerard-1.jpg 514w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/gerard-1-255x300.jpg 255w" sizes="(max-width: 514px) 100vw, 514px" /></p>
<h2><strong>Step #2 Add the Chrome extension </strong></h2>
<p>Use this link to add the <a href="https://scrapebook.net/?utm_source=BuzzInteractive.co&amp;utm_medium=BuzzBlog">ScrapeBook</a> extension:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-18512 size-large" src="https://static2.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/scrapebook-1024x304.jpg" alt="scrapebook extension" width="1024" height="304" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/scrapebook-1024x304.jpg 1024w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/scrapebook-300x89.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/scrapebook-768x228.jpg 768w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/scrapebook-700x208.jpg 700w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/scrapebook.jpg 1216w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Hit the blue button “Add to Chrome” to install this extension. As soon as you will add this Chrome extension, you’ll see “DOWNLOAD UIDs” under all the posts.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-18513 size-full" src="https://static.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/gerard-compte.jpg" alt="gerard compte" width="514" height="602" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/gerard-compte.jpg 514w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/gerard-compte-256x300.jpg 256w" sizes="(max-width: 514px) 100vw, 514px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That’s what this ScrapeBook Chrome Extension does. It gathers the UIDs of all the people who have liked a post or ad on your competitor’s Facebook page.</p>
<p>Click “DOWNLOAD UIDs” and get the data in a CSV file.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-18515 size-full" src="https://static.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/gerard-strategy.jpg" alt="gerard strategy" width="499" height="204" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/gerard-strategy.jpg 499w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/gerard-strategy-300x123.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 499px) 100vw, 499px" /></p>
<p>For instance, 68 people reacted to this post and you can squeeze a decent info from it. My advice would be to do this on posts that have hundreds of reactions if not thousands to get better results.</p>
<h2><strong>Step #3 Get More Information </strong></h2>
<p>Even with just the user&#8217;s IDs, you can do a lot of things. For example, you can auto-friend everyone. But, what I would like to do, instead, is extracting more useful information such as names and emails. It will help you build a great custom audience based on the users that are already interacting with your competitor’s content.</p>
<hr />
<p><em>#Getmore than just Facebook user IDs with the secret Chrome extension (names &amp; emails)</em><br /><a href='https://twitter.com/share?text=%23Getmore+than+just+Facebook+user+IDs+with+the+secret+Chrome+extension+%28names+%26amp%3B+emails%29&#038;via=buzz_interactve&#038;related=buzz_interactve&#038;url=https://www.buzzinteractive.co/how-to-steal-your-competitors-facebook-audience/' target='_blank'>Click To Tweet</a></p>
<hr />
<p>Here ScrapeBook will again come into play. It’s a cool tool that can squeeze valuable information out of Facebook posts. But it’s an invite-only tool so you have to see if a spot is available for you.</p>
<p>Once you gain access go to the “Post Emails Finder” feature. Then, copy and paste the value from the CSV file that you have recently downloaded using the ScrapeBook extension.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-18518 size-full" src="https://static.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/scrapebook-mails-finder.jpg" alt="scrapebook " width="705" height="395" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/scrapebook-mails-finder.jpg 705w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/scrapebook-mails-finder-300x168.jpg 300w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/scrapebook-mails-finder-700x392.jpg 700w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/scrapebook-mails-finder-539x303.jpg 539w" sizes="(max-width: 705px) 100vw, 705px" /></p>
<p>Enjoy the results.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-18517 size-full" src="https://static2.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/scrapebook-filter.jpg" alt="scrapebook filter" width="552" height="277" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/scrapebook-filter.jpg 552w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/scrapebook-filter-300x151.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 552px) 100vw, 552px" /></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The tool will only be able to extract information from accounts that have bad privacy settings. However, you’ll still be able to extract ample information to create a custom audience as you can use it on several posts. On average, if you’ll use this on 10-12 posts, you’ll be able to get more leads than with Facebook ads.</p>
<p>What’s best is that since these emails are associated with people’s Facebook accounts, so the audience you are going to create for your social media marketing will be highly targeted and have a high match rate.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Social Media is one of the largest platform and the quickest form for businesses if they want to get digitally active and get exposure of their service or product by a large number of people.</p>
<p>No one ever thought that social media networking sites would ever benefit businesses as it was merely seen as a medium for youngsters to get in contact with their friends and family. Soon the networking sites were revamped and were seen being thronged by many businesses either online or not and getting their customer base and brand identity to a whole new level.</p>
<p>Many businesses have integrated <strong><a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/social-media-services/">social media marketing</a></strong> in their marketing strategy and seen a drastic change in their customer base, brand awareness, recognition, and image, however for small businesses these sites turn into a mega triumph as compared to large businesses which we will talk about in the later stage. According to research, 75% of small businesses have been seen using social media as a marketing tool and it proved to be a really good strategy.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>How is Social Media Advantageous for Small Businesses in Marketing?</strong></h2>
<p>Old times have gone when small businesses used to find it difficult in bringing themselves up on the radar and due to their confined budgets, huge advertisements were not possible, which means low market share and growth along with a small customer base.</p>
<p>Large businesses would really take up a great amount of market share and would make it difficult for small businesses to step out of their niche.</p>
<p>Let’s talk about how <a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/social-media-marketing-tips-for-restaurant-business/">Social media can benefit a small business</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>1. Small Businesses are Closely Connected with Their Customers</strong></h3>
<p>Don’t take it wrong, large businesses do put their customers as the number one priority but small business’s structure is also small which means they don’t have to deal with large management issues so they can provide a great deal of attention to their customers.</p>
<p>A small business will have all the time available to deal with its customers’ concerns much more quickly and with much more effort. Many small-scale businesses really need to improve their image and create a strong customer base, therefore, keeping their customers satisfied is given immense importance.</p>
<p>How can such an attitude <strong><a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/7-effective-social-media-marketing-tips-enhance-online-business/">help small businesses in social media marketing</a></strong>? Small businesses are much more efficient in providing good customer service on social media; they have enough time to deal with their customers’ concerns in details and reply to their comments, reviews, or messages.</p>
<p>Customers really appreciate when a business creates a community-centric environment where customers feel an important part of the whole business and so this creates a strong customer relationship, therefore, the brand loyalty and image is improved which consequently increases business sales and customer base.</p>
<h3><strong>2. Advertising is Cost Effective</strong></h3>
<p>Social media has made it easy for small businesses to reach a large number of customers by investing less in the promotion of their brand which goes quite well with the budget available.</p>
<p>Small scale businesses through the use of cost-effective promotional services provided by social networking sites like Facebook are highly engaging, it reaches a large number of audience.</p>
<p>It is quite expensive to advertise and aware customers about any product development, discounts and much more through any other medium of marketing. Facebook advertisements have a geo-targeting feature which means that advertisements can be done in the current location of the business, therefore, investing in such ads is cheap, effective and will not exceed the budget.</p>
<p>Due to the reason that such small businesses know their customers from really close, they can set up promotional campaigns that are according to their specific needs and provide content that can be relatable to the customers.</p>
<p>Such promotional campaigns may boost the business-customer relationship along with making the brand well recognized within their market that may help them achieve a better competitive ground.</p>
<p>Not only that, this marketing is an effective way of attracting not only the current customers but also new ones with a low budget.</p>
<h3><strong>3. Small Businesses are More Personalized </strong></h3>
<p>Small business knows its customers as it gives emphasis to the customers much more than a large business therefore as a small business owner would know their customers’ thoughts and desires making it more personalized which will help in implementing a great marketing strategy. This will generate such a brand name and image that will be carved in the hearts of your customers.</p>
<p>When using social media marketing these attributes of a small company such as being market-oriented and developing a product that is in compliance with customer requirements can get you in the footprint of social media and allow you to gather and engage with a much wider market.</p>
<p>A small business will also be readily available to shout-out to its customers and exchange a few words with them through messages and comments which will generate an image about the brand that it really cares about its customers.</p>
<p>When we talk about large businesses, they are highly concentrated on their product development, management system and most importantly revenue, so giving personalized service is what they slack.</p>

<p>The fastest way seen to promote your brand is through social media sites so let’s talk about it.</p>
<h3><strong>1. Facebook Marketing</strong></h3>
<p>This one is the largest platform among the social media sites, where millions of people daily check-in to connect with people, to search for brands; attain their information etc.</p>
<p>It is thus an important platform for brand promotion and awareness but how can a restaurant business make full use of this networking site efficiently and effectively.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Creating a Fan Page</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The first and foremost part is to create a page which will help your restaurant business to put all the details regarding your brand; there are different tabs like, Home, About, Posts, Videos etc.</p>
<p>The about section includes all the details about your brand, such that website link, contact info, location, and others and it is an important area which will help the customers get an idea about the business and possibly allow to have a contact with you.</p>

<p>Especially for food businesses such as restaurants, marketing on social media through an array of cuisine images is a must.</p>
<p>In general, the posts should include your product’s images because customers need to learn about your product; new deals, any new product developed etc. Therefore, a restaurant business can include a variety of their cuisines, any new addition in any one of their cuisine, also you can create a look book of the entire menu with prices and full detail about the ingredients used.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use Videos as a Marketing Tool</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Nowadays videos are becoming immensely important as a part of marketing on social media, they go viral within seconds, and therefore it would turn out to be a good source of brand promotion and awareness.</p>
<p>Uploading videos maybe of how your food is made, or maybe have short interviews with your staff so that people learn about your team and feel like a part of your brand. You may also make videos on social service; helping others, giving free food to homeless and poor, which will create an emotional attachment for you with your clients.</p>
<p>This would work as a PR booster also allow more and more people to connect with your brand, boost the engagement rate and establish a brand image.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Promotional Campaigns</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Establish a high level of user participation and brand awareness by using campaigns such as contests, discounts, redeemable codes, etc. This will not only attract and boost engagement from current customers, but it can also convert users into potential customers and lead them to your restaurant.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Boost Your Posts</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Organically reaching a large number of people on Facebook is time-consuming and slow way, but you can spend small amounts of money to reach a large number of target audience.</p>
<p>Facebook also allows to geo-target your ads as you can control which location the ads should be seen, ads can target your type of niche and can grab the attention of people you target specifically.</p>
<h3><strong>2. Instagram Marketing</strong></h3>
<p>Instagram is a large platform for photo sharing and it stimulates visual posts only, therefore it can be a good source to have your restaurant business promoted.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Instagram works best with hashtags and can improve your brand’s awareness quickly.</p>
<p>Use the following methods to get your brand promoted and lure people to your establishment</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Share Your Menu </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You can make a post including your menu item to let people know about different types of meals available. The menu is important for a restaurant business because mostly that is the one thing people look for on social media sites.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Add High-Quality Images</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Take full advantage of this platform to promote your brand through images. Add high-quality images of a wide variety of your meals/cuisines.</p>
<p>You may also engage people and attract them to your restaurant by adding images of your restaurant to let them know about the environment it provides.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hashtag Usage</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Use hashtags for your specific niche to reach food lovers, this will increase your following and engagement of your posts. Furthermore, it will boost your restaurant’s awareness too.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Staff Appraisal and Videos</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Appraise your staff and increase customers’ engagement by adding staff videos and letting know people about their performance. This will encourage people to link themselves with the brand and generate an image in their minds that it is a fun place to hang in, while on the other hand the employees will feel enriched and boost the restaurant’s environment even more.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Brand Promotion</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You can also promote your posts and target to specific audience related to your niche, this will help to boost your following and improve the customer base.</p>
<h3><strong>3. Pinterest Marketing</strong></h3>
<p>Pinterest is another social media platform which helps to boost a large catalog of ideas where you can create boards on your home page.</p>
<p>The best and most relevant board for a restaurant business can be</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>You can set up many different boards and establish a following of customers. Research has shown that Pinterest is used mostly by women’s, therefore, the promotion of the restaurant business through this site can be beneficial.</p>
<p>Moreover, Pinterest also allows paid advertising, which will help generate a following and customer base quickly and promote your pins to a large number of people.</p>
<h3><strong>4. Twitter Marketing</strong></h3>
<p>A trendy social media site for restaurant businesses, whether small or big where power is of hashtags, just like Instagram.</p>
<p>You have 140 words at every update so the most successful way to get your brand promoted is by using links and images.</p>
<p>The real games isn’t about images on Twitter, therefore add links to your menu with using catchy lines that actually enables the users to click them, and links to your other social networking pages can be used to direct the audience to that site and allow them to learn more about your brand.</p>
<p>If you really want to have your brand to catch users’ attention you must time your tweets at different times such as at breakfast time if you have a breakfast deal, dinner time etc. Moreover, paid promotion is also a way to spread the words to a large number of people.</p>
<h3><strong>5. Foursquare Check-Ins</strong></h3>
<p>Foursquare is a social networking site where you can find the best places to eat, drink and shop around in your particular location. People use check-ins of places they go and leave reviews.</p>
<p>Register your business on this platform; see how many people are checking-in and how the reviews can help you understand what the people need improvements in. It can work as a way to add to people’s knowledge about your restaurant.</p>
<p>As we conclude Social Media is one of the largest platforms for almost anything now; it has made it easy to connect to millions of people at once. Not only social media has grown to its peak but mobile phones have also been growing in its usage level, which has given an immense boost to mobile apps and social sites, therefore, <strong><a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/social-media-services/">Social Media Marketing Services</a></strong> has become immensely important for almost all businesses.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Social Media is one of the largest platforms to interact with your audience and share your content. Millions of people check in daily which makes it possible to have your ideas shared with just one click to thousands of people at one time.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.buzzinteractive.co/">Digital Marketing Agencies</a></strong> rely heavily on Social Networking Sites for e-commerce business promotions as they have known that this is the fastest way to be dominant in the market; engage with thousands of audience, convert users into potential customers, and build brand recognition.</p>
<p>Facebook is the first name that comes into the minds of marketers when talking about marketing their brand but each social media site has different strategies and helps different businesses in their dealings.</p>
<h3><strong>1. Fully Consider Networks for Your Kind of Business</strong></h3>
<p>As we have mentioned above, Facebook is not the only medium to promote your business, different networks are used for different brand type. Let’s talk about it.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Facebook</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>One of the largest platforms for brand recognition, it is used for any brand type and can prove to be the fastest and the largest customer base booster. Most importantly e-commerce businesses can see a great improvement in their brand awareness.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Instagram</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The largest platform for businesses that depend heavily on images like clothing etc., many growing clothing brands are using Instagram to boost up their customers.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pinterest</strong><strong><br />
</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>A great source to shout out for your brand like Jewelry etc., because research has shown many women are seen on this social media platform.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Google+</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Need to reach people in the technology industry? Join Google+ communities and share your ideas, products and much more.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>LinkedIn</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Are you a manufacturer and looking to be a supplier for other businesses? Then this platform is a good source for you to reach out to other businesses, which is called B2B marketing.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h3><strong>2. </strong><strong>Share Valuable and Interesting Content</strong></h3>
<p>Social Media is all about building a relationship with your audience so share contents that are relevant yet interesting. It is important to have your audience engage with you and share your post because priority is given to have your brand recognized.</p>
<p>Value content will allow you to engage with existing customers and attract new customers enabling them to link to your brand as it means something to them. Valuable content can include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Promotions such as discounts for your product/service</li>
<li>Shouting out about any new product launch</li>
<li>Sharing helpful information that is related to your business</li>
</ul>
<p>There needs to be a balance when sharing posts, the audience would not like to see serious topics all the time they get a post from your page on their news feeds, a little humor will keep your audience active and revive their energy.</p>
<p>Memes are trendy and can work as a good way to get your audience to share the post and tag others. Note that, always share contents that come in compliance with your brand image.</p>
<p>Visual content proves to be the most engaging; almost all the businesses are working on sharing images and videos. Hiring Digital Agency for <strong><a href="http://www.buzzinteractive.co/">social media promotion</a></strong> is becoming common as posts are professionally designed because they reflect your brand image. Using a gif image is another way to visually attract customers.</p>
<h3><strong>3. Use Promotional Campaigns</strong></h3>
<p>New brands on social media are like a small piece of a puzzle, and it is really difficult to reach thousands of customers organically; it is not impossible but it may take time.</p>
<p>The best part about social media is that you can spend the little amount of money to get your content a mega boost in reaching your targeted audience.</p>
<p>Campaigns are intended to give incentives to your audience which will enable user participation.</p>
<p>Contests can be carried once or twice a month and rewards can be given, e.g. if you are a cookware business, you may decide to give a free deep cooking pot to the winner, this will not only help people engage with your brand but will also allow the customers to try out your product which can generate future sales.</p>
<h3><strong>4. Market Segmentation</strong></h3>
<p>Social Media sites are really effective in reaching out to audiences for your kind of business. It is however important because potential clients are only the ones who can relate themselves to your product.</p>
<p>Now it is easy as you can reach out specific targets by segmenting for your type of brand according to location, age, gender, interests and much more.</p>
<h3><strong>5. Customer Experience and Service</strong></h3>
<p>One of the most important parts of the social media site, customers really take the behavior of businesses into account and that attracts them the most.</p>
<p>The quality that customers are provided with sets an impression for your brand online; try to give your customer with all possible information about your brand including your location, phone number, website link etc. Nowadays social media sites are the largest platform used by people to acquire any e-commerce business’s information, therefore, you should provide the best customer experience.</p>
<p>Customer service really helps you improve your customer base, establish long term relations and much more. A good service given to your customer works as a “<strong>word-of-mouth” </strong>from the customer satisfied by your service will market you all over his/her social networking<strong>,</strong> and it is a good strategy to improve your brand image and awareness. Provide full information about the product that you have posted on your social media page e.g. price, quality and all possible details of your product.</p>
<p>Let’s say you entered an outlet, e.g. clothing, and all shirts are hanged without a price tag or the size, what impression will it generate?</p>
<p>Social Media is just like an online outlet for your brand, therefore, customer service should not be overlooked.</p>
<p>Other ways to provide customers with the best experience is to be really active, deal with their queries really fast, always check for your inbox and reply them quickly.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Summing up the informative Session</strong></h2>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/social-media-services/">Social Media Marketing</a></strong> is the best and most cost-effective way to get your e-commerce business a great boost in its sales, brand image, brand awareness, brand recognition, and customer base.</p>
<p>You can sell your products all over the world at any place and to any person and not just in your local surroundings, furthermore consumers would pay even a little extra money to get products right at their doorstep, therefore an online business with well-established links on social media is the best strategy to look into.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.buzzinteractive.co/social-media-services/">Social media marketing</a> is considered a rabbit hole, but when you learn about it, you will find out that’s not the case.</p>
<p>I have seen businesses flourish, promoting only through just two mediums Facebook and Instagram. It all depends on how, where, and when you target your customers and what you do to retain them. It is simple, you just need to know certain tips and tricks to enhance your business. But, what are those?</p>
<p>Let’s discuss some here;</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-16944 size-medium alignright" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/buzz1-1-225x300.png" alt="" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/buzz1-1-225x300.png 225w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/buzz1-1.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /></p>
<h3><b>Find your niche</b>:</h3>
<p>You need to ask yourself a couple of questions,</p>
<ul>
<li>You are dealing in B2B or B2C?</li>
<li>Who is your target audience?</li>
</ul>
<p>It is very important to know who you want to target because strategies change as the audience changes. ‘’For example, if you are targeting a group of teens, promoting your product to them will require a different theme, a different medium and so on.’’</p>
<p>Detailed knowledge of your company’s goal and the product that is to be marketed, will help develop an online strategy hence strengthening the web presence.<br />
	<div class="vc_empty_space"  style="height: 10px" ><span
			class="vc_empty_space_inner">
			<span class="empty_space_image"  ></span>
		</span></div>
<h3><strong>Select the network that best suits your business:<br />
</strong></h3>
<p>It is very important to market your product on a medium that is better suited for your business. You wouldn’t want to market your product to people who fall out of your audience circle, that will just be pure waste of time, money and effort. Find out which platform is trending among your targeted audience and the ones that fits your business idea.</p>
<p>Here is a list of platforms with their pros and cons to decide from and this image will help you select one or multiple for your business.<div class="image_with_text"><img itemprop="image" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/buzz4-1.png" alt="" /><h3 ></h3><span style="margin: 6px 0px;" class="separator transparent"></span></p>
<p></div>
<p>Hence a detailed research should be done before you start marketing on social networks, as to which medium is trending among the group of people being targeted, whether the content should be infographic or memes, videos, small text or detailed.</p>
	<div class="vc_empty_space"  style="height: 10px" ><span
			class="vc_empty_space_inner">
			<span class="empty_space_image"  ></span>
		</span></div>


<h3><strong>Select the right format to optimize platforms:<br />
</strong></h3>
<p><img class="wp-image-16950 size-medium alignright" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/12-2-225x300.png" alt="" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/12-2-225x300.png 225w, https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/12-2.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" />Anything that goes up on the internet will reflect your business’s image, value and name.This is how people will perceive and relate to your brand. Hence said;</p>
<p>‘’First impression matters’’</p>
<p>You need to know what format will be required to display your content on the social networks, what will attract your audience. Like photos for Instagram, meme for Facebook, short note on twitter and so on. Select the right platform with the right content to boost your business as it will reach the audience faster.</p>
<p>Our brain makes us believe;</p>
<p><strong>‘’Reading is hard, looking is easy’’</strong></p>
<p>A study showed how it works for Facebook let’s have a look;</p>
<div class="image_with_text"><img itemprop="image" src="https://www.buzzinteractive.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/buzz-2.png" alt="" /><h3 ></h3><span style="margin: 6px 0px;" class="separator transparent"></span></p>
<p></div>
	<div class="vc_empty_space"  style="height: 5px" ><span
			class="vc_empty_space_inner">
			<span class="empty_space_image"  ></span>
		</span></div>


<h3><strong>Increase your web presence:<br />
</strong></h3>
<p>The thing is that you aren’t acting in a vacuum, you have competitors to compete with and grab customers. To do that, strong and focused web presence is crucial, whether you are a small business or a corporate giant. Here’s how you do it;</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a website: the content of the website should be engaging, doesn’t matter you use photos, or text or memes in I but does it spark an interest for the visitor.</li>
</ul>
<p>Find out if your webpage is customer friendly,</p>
<p>How long a visitor stays on your page and so on.</p>
<ul>
